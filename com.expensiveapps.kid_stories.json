So, Chitranga left that city and came to a far-off city in search of food.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There he found the house of a wealthy man whose wife was a lazy and careless woman who would not close the doors of the house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Every day, Chitranga would sneak into the open house and have his fill. But he really could not enjoy his food because as soon as he came out of the house, street mongrels attacked him and severely wounded him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Chitranga thought, &ldquo;Oh, I made a mistake in coming here. Home was better even if there was no food. There was no struggle like this for food. Let me go home.&rdquo;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the end, Chitranga left that city and returned home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Seeing him return from abroad, Chitranga&rsquo;s friends asked him, &ldquo;Tell us everything about the country you have visited. How are the people there? What is their culture?&rdquo;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The dog said, &ldquo;The less said the better about that country. Everything is freely available because the women are careless. Yet your own kith and kin deprive you of this joy.&rdquo;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The croc was then impressed by the monkey&rsquo;s good advice and decided to fight the encroaching croc.
