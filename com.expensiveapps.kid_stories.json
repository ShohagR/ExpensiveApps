The bag had 50 gold coins in it. Sam searched high and low for the bag, but could not find it. Sam&rsquo;s friends and neighbours also joined in the search, but all their efforts were in vain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">After a couple of days, the ten year old daughter of a man working for Sam found the bag. She told her father about it. Her father identified the bag as the one that was missing, and immediately decided to take it to his master.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He gave the bag back to his master Sam, and asked him to check whether the bag had <strong>50<\/strong> gold coins. Sam was exultant to get the coins back, but he decided to play a trick. He shouted at his worker, &ldquo;there were <strong>75<\/strong> gold coins in this bag but you gave me only 50! Where are the other coins? You have stolen them!&rdquo;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The worker was shocked to hear this and pleaded his innocence. Selfish and greedy, Sam did not accept the worker&rsquo;s story, and decided to take the issue to court.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The judge heard both the sides. He questioned the daughter and the worker about the number of coins they had found in the bag, and they assured it was only <strong>50.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He cross-examined Sam and Sam replied, &ldquo;Yes my lord, I had <strong>75<\/strong> gold coins in my bag, and they gave me only <strong>50.<\/strong> Hence, it is quite obvious that they have stolen <strong>25<\/strong> coins!&rdquo;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The judge then asked, &ldquo;Are you sure that your bag had <strong>75<\/strong> coins?&rdquo; Sam nodded vigorously.The judge then made his judgment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">&ldquo;Since Sam lost a bag of <strong>75<\/strong> gold coins and the bag found by the girl had only <strong>50<\/strong> coins, it is obvious that the bag that was found does not belong to Sam. It was lost by someone else.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">If anyone finds a bag of <strong>75<\/strong> gold coins, I will declare that it belongs to Sam.
