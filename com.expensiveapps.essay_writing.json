Not only does he reek of stale smoke, he also has bad breath, much to the dread of non-smokers. However, the effects of smoking are far more insidious than the offensive smell associated with smokers.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Cigarette smoke contains many toxic substances like carbon monoxide, nicotine and carcinogens that not only cause irreparable damage to the smoker, but also to those around him who inhale the smoke.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Carbon monoxide reduces blood capacity to carry oxygen, thus causing fatigue and panting even with the slightest physical exertion. The lack of oxygen in the body acts as a catalyst that accelerates the aging process, causing wrinkles.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Nicotine contained in cigarette smoke reduces the activity of the brain and nervous system. It also raises the risk of high blood pressure. Nicotine causes the contraction of blood vessels and decrease of blood supply. This ultimately leads to heart attacks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Smokers are at a higher risk of developing certain kinds of cancers because cigarette smoke contains carcinogens. Long-time smokers often develop cancers of the mouth, larynx and lungs.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Smoking not only endangers the smoker himself but also those who inhale secondary smoke -- smoke exhaled y smokers.

I felt a harsh pull. Within a split second I was sprawled on the pavement. I felt numb and everything around me became blur. I heard people shouting, but I was too dazed to talk and too shocked to even get up. I did not remember anything after that. When I regained consciousness. I was in the hospital and my legs and arms were bandaged. Yet I felt no sensation or pain. I was just too weak to even move.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>'What happened?'<\/strong> I kept asking myself.

People were gathering on the beach and pointing at the sea which was receding quickly into the horizon. Some people were excitedly picking up shell and even fish that had been exposed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Then Mr Dillon heard the Japanese man at the table next to theirs shouting `Tsunami! Tsunami!'. The Japanese man and his family jumped from their seats, gesticulating wildly to everyone, and dashed for the exit. Although no one understood Japanese, Mr and Mrs Dillon sensed that their lives were in danger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">All of a sudden a gigantic wall of water came crashing through the restaurant windows, knocking over every person and object. Mr Dillon and his wife grabbed their two children's hands. However, Tom Dillon's little hand slipped from his mother's grip and he was tossed by the waves. By some miracle, somebody saw his head bobbing above the water and snatched him up in time. Just as forcefully, the waves pulled back, tugging along whatever it could.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Fortunately, the Dillons and everyone else in the restaurant had escaped onto drier ground.

Everyone literally trembled with fear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The survivors tried to go as far inland as they could.

Considering Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Confucianism and Judaism, we find that religions have influenced every aspect of the life of man.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Among the early Jews, religion not only 'influenced' government, it was government. Palestine, until the 8th century B.C. was ruled by 'Priests-Kings' who claimed divine sanction for all their decisions. Their appointment was a religious rite. And this has more or less influenced the Western theory of monarchy ever since. The theory of the <strong>'Divine Right of Kings'<\/strong> was formally propounded in Britain in the 16th century, based on New Testament social philosophy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Officially rejected, it has, nevertheless, influenced the monarch to subject relationship in many countries ever since. Christianity, for its first 300 years, lived in more or less opposition to the Roman Empire ... until the days of Constantine, who, in <strong>325 A.D.<\/strong> became the first Christian monarch of the Holy Roman Empire. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But of course the temporal and spiritual functions of government had long since been separated between Pope and Emperor, King and Archbishop, and the relations between these have shown all the 'ups and downs' one might expect in subsequent history. In most countries today, government is carried out on democratic lines, the monarch retaining little more than a strong 'influence' and powers of sanction and veto.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Religion has, in result, played an important part in the foreign affairs of countries. In this, the Moslem and Christian religious are cases in point. The faithful Muslim has always been permitted to take up arms in the defense of his religion, or to further its cause. The outcome has been wars against the Jews and the Christians. The Christians, likewise, considered it their duty to oust the Moslem Turks from the<strong> 'Holy Places'<\/strong> of Palestine in the middle ages, and long drawn-out <strong>'crusades'<\/strong> were the result, costly in manpower, wealth and goodwill to both sides.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> If we examine the causes of most wars from mediaeval times to the 17th century, in Europe and the Middle East, we find religion was the direct cause, as between Christian and Saracen in Europe; sometimes, it was used as a cloak to further a political or economic struggle, or as a sanction to proceed with a war of aggression where legal claims could be proved <strong>(Henry V, Charles VI of France).<\/strong> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Occasionally, the war was on a religious issue such as Protestantism versus Roman Catholicism. The Spanish Inquisition, as a part of the counter reformation, forcibly attempted to <strong>'Convert'<\/strong> Protestant prisoners to Catholicism for the ultimate good of their own souls! Religious massacres have been commonplace in India in the past, and it says much for the democratic spirit of the New Malaysia that, today, Christians, Muslims and Hindus are able to live together in harmony.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Among other influences, those on the social customs of countries have been important. The Western 'weekend' is based on the Christian Sunday which in turn replaced the Jewish Sabbath. Bank Holidays such as Easter Monday and Whit Monday have a religious origin - just as do the sequence of holidays proper to the Chinese and Indians, beginning with Chinese New Year. But the effect of religion on social custom goes much deeper. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It certainly produced the caste system in India and was partly responsible for the class system in Europe, but nowadays, both Hinduism and Christianity repudiate these arbitrary divisions among people. The theories of marriage and general conduct in social life also stem from the teaching of the respective world-religions and have become a fixed part of the pattern of life where they apply.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The most important influence of religion is upon morality. Modern law is based on a mixture of Roman law and religious principle. Its sanction is authority. Moral law, which is behind national and international legal systems, has behind it the final sanction - the Will of God. In this connection, each world-religion has made its own individual contribution to the sum-total of world morality, despite the fact that certain moral precepts are held in common by them all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> If we look to the Muslim faith, we find there an admirable teaching about self-discipline; to the Hindu faith, about non-violence; to the Christian faith, about love; to the Buddhist faith, about contemplation and to Confucianism, about duties to society and the family. The most important commonly-held piece of teaching is that we should behave towards others as we should wish them to behave towards us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The great Religions not only carry profound influence today, but also are, <strong>(and will remain)<\/strong> integral part in the life of man.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148660","category_id":"85438","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Vitamins<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong><\/span> Vitamins are also known as supplements. Nowadays, one can get many types of vitamins as well as herbs in capsules or tablets from the pharmacies, clinics or even the supermarket. There are basically two types of vitamins : natural and synthetic. The latter is manufactured in laboratories whereas the former is extracted from natural sources. Supplements have become very popular since the last few decades both in the East and the West.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Although most physicians and specialists recommend the intake of vitamins only if the person is suffering from certain deficiency in his or her diet, it has become almost a trend for most people to consume vitamins on a regular basis. There is widespread belief that vitamins promote good health, aids in weight loss and improve complexion among others. There are others who believe that certain vitamins help prevent cancer and other dangerous diseases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The multibillionaire dollar vitamin industry is a rapidly expanding one as increasing number of people including children and teenagers consume vitamins to enhance their health and general well being. there is some truth tot he belief that vitamins form an essential part of a person's diet. This mainly springs from the fact that most of our food <strong>(except foods such as lettuce, fruits and juices)<\/strong> are cooked using heat and hence loses its properties.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Not may of us eat salads and raw vegetables such as carrots, cauliflowers, broccoli and leafy vegetables. Hence, overcooking or even steaming these vegetables which employs extreme heat results in us eating food which have lost its nutritional content.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In addition, most of us also tend to eat more refined than complex carbohydrates. The former is more popular such as polished rice, pasta, white bread and others which have almost no nutritional benefits. polishing is a process that strips carbohydram of fiber and other essential vitamins. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Hence, vitamins provide these important elements that are missing in our diet. Unlike in the west, Asians generally do not consume much fresh vegetable or fruit juices and most of our drinks here are spiked with sugar. Many of us also tend to drink copious amounts of soft drinks which can cause diabetes and other health complications. young people too tend to avoid or reduce vegetables and fruits in their diet, preferring junk food or fast food.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Hence, vitamins play a role in ensuring we maintain a balanced diet. supplements provide the essential vitamins lacking in our meals due to our unhealthy eating habits.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148661","category_id":"85439","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Describe an unforgettable incident that you saw on your way home from school<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong><\/span> Dark rain clouds were gathering in the sky.

Humans compared to animals or plants are endowed with a sense of spirituality and yearning for a close contact with our creator.

In fact most of the troubles in the world stem from religious fanatism or extremism. Religious fanatics take their religious ideology to extremes and in their desire to propagate the teachings of their faith and ensure all the religious principles are adhered to, they resort to violent methods. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The bombing of the World Trade Center in New York in <strong>2001<\/strong> is a perfect example as well as the killings of Muslims in Gujarat, India in <strong>2002<\/strong> ad the Bali bombing in that same year. Thousands of innocent lives were lost in these tragedies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Despite religion teaching tolerance, acceptance, good deeds and moral values, these fanatics hijack their own religion for personal ends. Religious fundamentalists are to a certain extent irrational as they defy universal values of respect, freedom of belief and other fundamental human rights. it is almost an impossible task to encourage them to think about the rights of others -- all they care about is to achieve their goals through killings and destruction. There is little respect for other faiths and human values as they consider the former as infidels who deserve <strong>\"God's\"<\/strong> punishment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Religion too can be abused. many so-called religious leaders have exploited religion to their own ends and the sad irony is that many of us have fallen victims to such irrationality. In multicultural and multi-religious nation, there is a vital need for them to understand, accept and practice tolerance vis a vis other faiths. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Thus, it is very important that we inculcate respect for other faiths and do not stray into fundamentalism which would ultimately destroy the harmony in the country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Children should be exposed to the multi faiths in the country. They should be encouraged to learn about other religions, their principles and commandments.

The physically disabled are those physically handicapped such as the crippled, the blind, the mute as well those having some form of physical deformities. Those mentally disabled suffer from mental retardation such as cerebral palsy and down syndrome among others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There are thousands of disabled people in Asia and many face discrimination on a regular basis which takes many forms. Very few employers hire disabled people as the latter is considered more a liability than an asset in the organization. However, these fears are completely unfounded. Many a blind and hearing impaired persons have contributed tremendously to organizations they are attached to. In fact, there are many cases of how disabled personalities have done themselves proud by being their own bosses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Their success stories include those how run their own business such as shops, restaurants, handicraft centers in addition to those who have become teachers and professionals through sheer hard work and determination.

In fact, the awareness should start from a young age. Instead of setting up special schools for the disabled, the government should institute regulations that abolish such schools and the disabled children sent to regular schools. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">this would enable the regular students to understand and accept their peers despite the latter being obviously disadvantaged. the disabled children too would not suffer from low esteem or even feel embarrassed mixing with regular children.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In addition, most of our public infrastructure, public transport and government buildings are not disabled-friendly.

Friendships are easily formed when we are young and do not demand too much out of it. According to studies and research, humans tend to form highest number of friendships at kindergarten and primary level. However, one tends to have less friends as one grows older and wiser. This is because we realize there are good friends and bad ones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The saying that a friend in need is a friend indeed is very apt in this scenario because good friends are those who are reliable and trustworthy. at a younger age, our demands are not too high regarding friendships as we rely mostly on our parents, siblings and relatives for important things. The friends we formed at this age are merely considered playmates rather than companions and confidants. Thus, our expectations of them are not high.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">More serious friendships are formed when one enters puberty and achieves certain level of maturity. the latter allows one to forge fellowship with those who share the same interests, passion as well as similar moral and religious values. Thus, it is not surprising to observe that in some Asian country, mature students at the upper secondary level have friends of the same ethnic and religious backgrounds. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">At the university level, it is even more apparent. Even the Ministry of education has voiced concern over this phenomenon where polarization is prominent. The Indians, Chinese and Malays hardly mix with each other and are seen usually in the company of their own kind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">One of the main reasons for polarization among university students is that as they reach a certain level of maturity, common binding factors such as religion, customs and traditions play important role in selection of friends or mates. In addition, since majority of these students come from rural backgrounds where there is not much cultural interchange, they feel rather awkward to forge friendships with students of other races. However, this does not mean the students are racist or suffer from superiority complex. Thus, the university should introduce more programs that allow cultural and religious mixing and understanding of the other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Nevertheless, in the working world, a different scenario prevails. One finds Indians, Chinese and other races forging stable and long lasting friendships. This is most probably due o the fact that to be productive in one's work, one has to believe in team work. The latter actually enhances the bond between the workers and eventually long lasting friendships are formed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> In fact, this situation has even led to many inter racial marriages between the three major races. the products of the intermarriages are very unique as they have friends and relatives from both ethnic backgrounds.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148665","category_id":"85443","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Write a story ending with (: \"...) - We said our goodbyes and went our separate ways\"<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong> <\/span>The canteen was crowded with campers, all ravenous after the day's activities. To my relief, I spotted an empty place at one of the long tables. I walked there quickly and put my tray down. Just as I did so, I felt a bump against my hip. Then there was a clatter as a tray dropped on the table and curry splattered everywhere. \"Yikes!\" Someone yelled, followed by gales of laughter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Curry was dripping all over my new camp shirt and my new jeans, and I could not find any humor in the situation. \"Can't you look where you are going, you clumsy oaf! And what's so funny anyway?\"' I shouted, glaring at the culprit, a lanky boy with wild hair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>\"Sorry!<\/strong> Can't help laughing!

Before he could slide into place, he was spotted by the Camp Commandant. As a punishment for being late, he was made to do a hundred pushups. As we walked past him, on the way to breakfast, I let out a loud chortle. \"Sorry. I can't help laughing. You look so funny,\" I said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">So the war of words began with the wild-haired boy, whose name, I found out, was Ben. A few days later, when I had trouble rappelling, it was Ben's turn to laugh at me and make rude jokes. Then, I had my revenge when Ben capsized his canoe. By now, however, I was beginning to regret this \"war\"; there was something mean-spirited about it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">On the last day, we went for an extended mountain trek. On the way down, I hurt my ankle slightly. I was able to stumble on but got left further and further behind my patrol. After some time, they were out of sight. Though, I knew I would get back to the camp if I just kept on the track.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> I was getting anxious as evening fell. I tried to walk faster but my ankle was getting worse. Then, as I was negotiating a path that clung to the mountain side, I tripped. My unstable feet slid on the muddy ground, and, unable to stop myself, I slid right off the path and down the ravine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Fortunately, my fall was stopped by a clump of bamboo. I saw that I was about ten meters below the track. There was no way I could climb up the slope, with my hurt ankle, which now seemed broken. I shouted for help, but in my heart, I knew it would be in vain, as I had been left far behind the group. All I could hope for was that they would send a search party for me. So, I could only wait.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It got dark and I became afraid. Then, I saw a faint light, and heard a voice calling out my name. I recognized the voice as Ben's.&nbsp;<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"Ben! Help! I'm down here!\" I shouted.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Soon, I saw Ben's wild-haired silhouette on the top of the ravine and the light of his torch shining down at me. \"Hold on. I'll be there soon,\" he said. In a few minutes, Ben was rappelling down the slope. He examined my ankle and, after pronouncing it was not broken, bound it up, gently and expertly. As he was doing so, some others from the search party arrived. I was brought back to camp, not much the worse for my misadventure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The next day was a flurry of activities so I was unable to speak to Ben until we were boarding the buses which would take us back to our respective homes.

The advent of the Internet and services provided through it, has enabled many of us to gain access to instant and a variety of news and entertainment.

However, consumers must ensure the news reported in the media is accurate and not one-sided by looking at its contents critically and voicing their views on certain issues.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148669","category_id":"85447","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A Sad Occasion<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong> <\/span>I am the youngest in a family of six children. My eldest brother. Ali, was almost twenty-three when tragedy struck suddenly to deprive our family of a filial son and loving brother.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I came home from school that day, cheerful because I had won the top prize in a school mathematics competition.

Over the intervening centuries the practice has evolved for three main purposes; human consumption, irrigation, and industrial use. Since rainfall is never sufficiently uniform to provide a reliable water source from normal river flow, the reservoir has always been a great boon, spanning as it does lengthy periods of drought. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There are, of course, other reasons for damming a river. Following heavy storms in mountainous areas more water than a river can carry will flow down to the plain, inundating large areas often destroying crops, homes and animal and human life. Mountain passes, if dammed, give the opportunity not only to control the flow of flood water at its peak but also to retain large quantities for controlled use in dry weather. This control of water works from sea to river as well as from to sea. An example is the recently constructed Thames barrier below Woolwich on the River Thames in England.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> This consists of solid pillars across the river with massive steel plates between each pillar which can be raised or lowered mechanically. The object is to protect the low-lying parts of London when a certain combination of wind and tide raises the water level by as much as thirty feet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A further use of the dam is to produce hydroelectric power, the power station, of course, being built below the level of the dam. Water is channeled through conduits and used as mechanical power for the turbines. It is then returned to the river. Reservoir water is also used today in vast quantities in nuclear power stations for cooling and other purposes and is similarly returned to the river or to the sea.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Some rivers in their natural state are not navigable by large vessels, or run dry in seasons of drought. Where such rivers can be dammed they can be given a constant depth for purposes of navigation, and this benefits a country's communication system.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">More often than not a dam may be central in a multipurpose scheme including most of the functions outlined above. This is particularly true in countries lying in temperate zones, where water shortage can be a nuisance but is rarely a disaster.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Matters are different in underdeveloped countries which are hot, dry and barren. In these areas populations are often nomadic, driving flocks and herds from waterhole to waterhole, or scratching a mere subsistence from the soil. Drought means disease, hunger, dehydration and death to animals and humans alike. The damming of major rivers such as the Nile is crucial to life itself, and the control of their floodwater for irrigation purposes essential, but even this is not preventing large tracts of North East Africa from reverting to desert.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Perhaps of least importance is the social value of a reservoir. Some stocked with trout, provide good fishing, and most are used by sailing clubs, and for other aquatic sports. A reservoir is also a great attraction to water-loving birds and often becomes an interesting staging-post for migrations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Damming a river can also cause problems. A great area of land, with its trees, flora and fauna, farms and houses, has to be inundated. Neither the resident, who have to resettle elsewhere, nor the environmentalists, appreciate this. The problem is more acute when the countryside about to be spoilt is environmentally unique, as in a recent case in Australia, where attempts were made to involve Prince Charles and Princess Diana in the dispute. Creating an artificial lake inevitably changes the character of a large area. Farmland is destroyed, natural scenery, in the opinion of some, despoiled. People have to move, inconveniently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A second drawback may be political. Many rivers flow through more than one country, that lying higher up the river having the whip-hand. A dam built for one country's benefit may be much to the detriment of another. The USSR has been in dispute with Turkey over this matter as has Egypt with the Sudan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Dams are vulnerable to air attack in wartime. The destruction of the Mohne See dam in the Second World War brought the industry of the Ruhr to a virtual standstill, as well as causing loss of life. There have also been cases of the collapse of dams due to inadequate strength and imperfect design.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148671","category_id":"85449","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A Ghostly Encounter<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong> <\/span>There are people who believe in ghosts and there are people who don't. I myself was a skeptic a few years ago. All that changed when I had a paranormal experience one fateful Sunday just a year ago.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I had gone to Malacca with my three friends. Ali, Alex and Bishek, during the school holidays. we went to a quiet village and a relative of my friend's had made us welcome and offered us the use of one his rooms. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The village was a far cry from the city where we lived. There was no hustle and tussle of the rat-race found in the city. the days moved at a leisurely pace and we had lots of fun fishing in the river and climbing trees to pluck rambutans and mangoes. It seemed that life in the village was absolutely carefree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">One day, Ali claimed that he had heard that there was a haunted house at the outskirts of the village. He said that the house was very old and was in a badly ruined condition but none of the villagers would go near it. We thought that Ali was just pulling our legs when our host, Mahmud, stepped in. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">We asked Mahmud if there was such a house and he assured us that indeed there was. he also advised to stay away from the haunted house. He seemed to be in earnest but we brushed aside his admonitions. None among the four of us at that time believed in the existence of ghosts and we attributed such tales to overworked human imagination and folklore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">That night, Alex suggested that we go to the presumed haunted house and prove to the rest of the superstitious villagers once and for all that there was no such thing as ghosts. We readily agreed to this plan and we made our way to the house in question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When we reached the dilapidated house, we felt an eerie chill, yet not even a gentle breeze was blowing. We flashed our torchlights and made our way to the house. The house had no door and we boldly walked in. There were still bits and pieces of old furniture strewn all over the floor and there were cobwebs hanging on the walls and ceilings. Insects and birds had built their nests inside the house. we smiled at this sight for this is an excellent example where the tiniest of God's creatures had made this place their home when man in his false superstition had abandoned.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Just then, we heard a terrifying scream. We had goosebumps and felt our hairs standing on ends. We looked at one another n fright. Then, a light formed in the middle of the room and a ghostly apparition appeared right before our eyes. The face was that o the ugliest woman we had ever seen. Her face had long line of open scars and we could see maggots and worms oozing out from the open scabs. She was floating in the air and her feet were not visible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">For a few seconds, we were dumbstruck and then in unison we fled from the house as fast as our legs could carry. We ran all the way to Mahmud's house and stopped to catch our breath only we have locked ourselves in our room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The next day, all of us were down with a high fever. Mahmud called the doctor and we were each given an injection and prescribed a course of medicine. We were bedridden for three days. When we had recovered, we told Mahmud what had happened. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He smiled and said that he had guessed as much as it was odd that all four of us should be taken ill at the same time.

My friends pestered me to approach her convincingly arguing that I would never ever get the chance of such a close encounter. I plucked up courage and approached the table very diffidently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">She flashed a smile.

She then proceeded to ask some questions about myself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> I told her briefly about my background and the reason I was there. she grinned widely and wished me \"happy birthday\" before placing her hands in the bag to withdraw an expensive looking pen.

The concept is very popular in the advanced or rich countries such as United States, Australia, United Kingdom and other western nation. In Laos, the concept is rather alien as may look at volunteering as rendering help without expecting payment in return as a waste of time and effort. However, there are many benefits one can gain through volunteering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When one volunteers to help out someone such as a friend, teacher or parent, one is immediately seen as selfless and helpful. When you help a teacher to clean he classroom or get involved in cleanliness campaign at the school level or other community projects, your standing would be elevated. Teachers and adults would look at a young person who volunteers his or her time for a certain activity as mature, responsible and deserving of respect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In addition, volunteering with an organization such as orphanages, community centers and other non-profit organizations such as the Society for Prevention of Cruelty towards Animal and other welfare organizations allows you to interact with society at large. In addition to helping these organizations carry out their duties, you not only gain experience but can learn a variety of skills. This is especially beneficial for students.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Even though one is not being paid, through volunteering time, effort and skills one would learn more than what money can buy. You can learn to be bold, assertive, independent as well express your opinions and gain communication and interpersonal skills. In Laos, this is lacking. Thus, the responsibility falls on the teachers to encourage students to volunteer their times not only for school activities but to spend their leisure in helping out community-based organizations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Volunteering also allows one to become more mature at a relatively younger age. When you are exposed to volunteering at a young age be it at the home front, school or their organizations, you would learn the importance of responsibility in carrying out your duties to the best of your ability. Embarking on volunteer activities would enable one to learn survival skills such as responsibility, ability to express ideas as well as the importance of hard work and diligence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Volunteering also exposes one to many interesting ideas and issues. For example, if you volunteer your time regularly at a charity organization, you would learn how the organization works and the importance of team work, and other essential ideas related to the day-to-day operations. of the organizations. You will not only enhance your general knowledge, but also learn how to deal with problems, challenges as well dealing with different types of personalities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Thus, there are many benefits to be gained by volunteering.

So the two boys cornered their mothers who happened by a strange act of fate to be having tea the next day together.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The two mothers knew they could not wrangle their way out of the situation and so graciously revealed the family skeleton.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Chuan was the eldest son of the first wife while Seng was the youngest son of the second wife. Chuan's mother passed away after his birth and that China lady was his milk mother. Huat's mother, their grandmother married into the family so that she could ensure the growth of the clan. Altogether she had six sons and three daughters. She treated Chuan justly. Unfortunately her husband died suddenly of a heart attack. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">She was forced to take over the business and ran it so efficiently that she turned it into a multi-million business empire. Her household was run by the China lady who favoured only Chuan and Seng. She just concentrated on her business. Her right-hand man influenced her to cut Chuan out of the business and install her favourite son, Seng as the sole heir.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Of course, Chuan protested vehemently seeing that he too had played his role in stabilizing the company after his father's death. Even Seng tried to talk his mother out of it, an action known only to both mother and son as Seng had to be wary of the cunning sly right-hand man. Chuan thought Seng had a hand in stealing his birthright from him and he was furious. He refused to talk to his stepbrother and since that day, he acted as though Seng never existed. This was the scenario for five years until the right-hand man died.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The matriarch realised her mistake and on the influence of the China lady, reinstated Chuan as an equal shareholder together with the other six sons. She held an equal share. Despite his reinstatement, Chuan did not forgive his stepbrother and continued to have nothing to do to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The return of the China lady brought the two brothers together. She revealed the truth. The old family feud ended.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The two cousins could now openly be friends, much to the pleasure of the two mothers. Seng rumpled Huat's hair, \"You didn't fool me. I knew you two were friends.\"&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Chuan smiled sheepishly, \"That was our quarrel, not theirs. Hock, I wasn't fooled either !\"<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148676","category_id":"85454","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Caught in a long queue<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong> <\/span>Shanti looked at the trolleys of those ahead of her in the queue. She had pushed her trolley from one end of the cashiers' counters to the other end. There were some unmanned counters. Those manned boasted of long queues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Sighing in resignation, she mechanically pushed her trolley to one she thought was not that long. How wrong she could be! Three of the customers had heavily laden trolleys while two others had double trolleys. She was the ninth person in the line. Before she could relax, she was sandwiched when two more customers lined up behind her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Shanti smiled sympathetically to which one responded with a casual shrug and a knowing smile. Then she heard the cashier calling out to her assistant to get the first customer's fresh vegetables weighed and priced. A quiet voice told the cashier she would forgo those two purchases. Shanti nodded her head sagely at the lady's understanding. After arranging all her purchases into her green bags, that customer paid for her purchases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The next in line was very quick and left the counter with two small plastic bags. The third customer had a heavy load. She was quick in clearing her trolley of purchases and the cashier's assistant was just as quick in repacking into the trolley after the cashier had scanned the prices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Then it came to the fourth customer. She had a full trolley too. She was a tortoise in putting the purchases on the conveyer belt. She wanted to arrange them into the different categories. She even told the assistant off for packing her things wrongly. \"The customer is always right.\" The flustered assistant unpacked and did not venture to continue to pack for this customer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">By the time the fifth customer was attended to, a good forty-five minutes had elapsed. The double-trolley customer did not have many purchases. She had two trolleys because she had four big cartons of can drinks plus six cartons of box drinks. The cashier just scanned the price code without taking out these things from the trolley. That saved lots of waiting time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">However, the sixth customer's two trolleys had assorted items. She took some time laying out her purchases and the cashier had more scanning to do. All three had to work fast so as not to hold back the others in queue. Even then the whole operation took about thirty minutes.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The seventh and eighth customers had their trolleys emptied, the goods scanned and repacked into plastic bags. They both took about twenty minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Then it came to Shanti's turn, the ninth in line. She was searching for her member card as well as her credit card in her handbag. She had to look into three compartments before she found them. Luckily she did not leave her wallet at home. She had been guilty of such absent-mindedness in the past.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">She tried to put her things on the belt but in her hurry, her butter fingers made her clumsy. She laughed nervously at herself. Fortunately the two staff members were patient and understanding. They waited quietly. It could be they were taking a breather after clearing the trolleys of eight customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Shanti had her eco-green bags hanging on the trolley. The packer packed all the purchases into the bags and arranged them with the heavy ones at the base and the soft and perishable on top.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Shanti smiled her thanks at the sensible packer. She signed on the credit card printout. She took her receipt and credit card slip. She checked the receipt quickly for items and pricing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Shanti pushed her trolley away from the counter. She was glad she did not have to queue too long. From the time she queued up to the time she was served, it took less than two hours for her to be served. She heaved a sigh of relief that she had chosen the right queue. She noticed that some queues were quite slow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Shanti reminded herself for the umpteenth time not to go shopping for essential goods during the weekends or public holidays. She could not do it in the early morning hours or late at night. Shanti is a career woman. Maybe she should do shopping during her Friday long lunch break. But almost everyone thinks likewise, especially the career women.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Shanti consoled herself that it did not take too long, despite the long queues at almost all counters.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148677","category_id":"85455","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Who is Steve Jobs?<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong><\/span> Steve job's death on October<strong> 5, 2011,<\/strong> was mourned worldwide.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Steve jobs, the innovator, inventor and visionary, changed the world just as Thomas Edison did. for previous generations. He invented something we didn't know we needed and now we can't do without it. His hard work and dedication made a difference in the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Billions of people in the future will no doubt benefit from his inventions, some of which have yet to be seen. Jobs changed how we listened to music, communicate, consume and create, inventing the personal computer, the iPod, the iPhone, and the Wad, to list four of the <strong>338<\/strong> things he patented before dying at age 56 from cancer complications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Steven Paul <strong>\"Steve\"<\/strong> Jobs<strong> (February 24, 1955 - October 5, 2011)<\/strong> was an American business magnate and inventor. His numerous awards and acknowledgements by influential mass media and iconic fellow players and practitioners bore testimony to his talents and recognition from the industry itself and the adoring public.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the late <strong>1970s,<\/strong> jobs, with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Mike Markkula, and others, designed, developed, and marketed one of the first commercially successful lines of personal computers, the Apple II series.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">To Jobs, \"Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower. Apple make money by innovation. It requires a lot of disciplines to turn really interesting ideas and fledgling technologies into a company that can continue to innovate for years.\" Disciplines got jobs where he was - he started building kits in a garage!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">His innovations were not only functional but entertaining: \"We're having fun. Our customers really like our products. We're always trying to do better. I want to put a ding in the universe.\"&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the early <strong>1980s,<\/strong> jobs was among the first to see the commercial potential of the mouse-driven graphical user interface which led to the creation of the Macintosh.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In 1984, jobs resigned from Apple and founded NeXT. Apple's subsequent <strong>1996<\/strong> buyout of NeXT brought jobs back to the company he co-founded, and he served as its <strong>CEO<\/strong> from 1997 until his second leave of absence in <strong>2011,<\/strong> before his demise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Jobs emphasized the importance of design and understood the crucial role aesthetics play in public appeal. The development of his products that are both functional and elegant earned him a devoted following. \"Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">While jobs was a persuasive and charismatic director for Apple, some employees had described him as an erratic and temperamental manager. Jobs was both admired and criticised for his consummate skill at persuasion and salesmanship. Much has been made of jobs' aggressive and demanding personality. Fortune wrote that he \"was considered one of Silicon Valley's leading egomaniacs\".<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Jobs had his individualistic approach to management, business and work. \"A lot of companies have chosen to downsize, and maybe that was the right thing for them. We chose a different path. Our belief was that if we kept putting great products in front of customers, they would continue to open their wallets.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Jobs had this to say of his management style. \"My model for business is The Beatles: They were four guys that kept each other's negative tendencies in check; they balanced each other. The total was greater than the sum of the parts. Great things in business are not done by one person, they are done by a team of people. The people who are doing the work are the moving force behind the Macintosh. My job is to create a space for them, to clear out the rest of the organisation and keep it at bay.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Jobs was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs of California. Jobs' biological parents, Abdulfattah Jandali, and Joanne Simpson <strong>(graduate students)<\/strong> later married, giving birth to and raising jobs' biological sister, the novelist Mona Simpson.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Jobs married Laurene Powell, on March <strong>18, 1991.<\/strong> The couple have a son, Reed Paul jobs, and two other children.

I stared straight ahead of me at the wooden house with its main door and windows hanging loosely from the hinges.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As I looked at the dilapidated empty ruins, my mind traveled nostalgically to my years as a toddler and a teenager.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> I stayed here until I was <strong>15.<\/strong> Now the house was a shadow of its grandeur when it was our family home. It was abandoned after a heavy thunderstorm when strong winds carried off the roof one dark wet night.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Located in a spacious compound dotted with fruit trees, tall giant trees and flowering shrubs and bushes, the <strong>\"Big House\"<\/strong> stood like a palace among the quaint, small kampong houses. The far end of the compound was bordered by a tributary of the main river where we fished and swam. The front faced the busy main road.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The house had a sprawling look, with annexes added as the clan grew in size. My fraternal grandparents stayed with us so did my bachelor uncles and spinster aunties. My parents and the brood numbering <strong>7<\/strong> were residents too.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">My eyes moved to the side of the rickety door as I spied with my third eye the row of sandals and slippers that adorned the entrance. We were not allowed to run barefoot in the compound so there were hundreds of foot attire lined up for our use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I entered the house into the spacious living room. It was lighted by the sun through the sky roof. I spun round and saw the \"coffee-shop\" set-up in the right corner. Here was where Papa and his cronies would sit in their plastic easy lazy chairs and chat about business, football, government and families. Mother just prepared hot tea and hot coffee, setting them down on a low square wooden coffee table and leaving them to indulge in men talk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">At the other end, far away from the men was the TV corner where the womenfolk would be glued to their soap operas. Sometimes the children joined in but they were usually shooed off to complete their homework.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the centre were the sofas and settees for guests and visitors or for us, the children to laze on and jump up and down. This area was usually empty, despite the cool comfort of the seats. Male visitors would seat themselves at the \"coffee-shop\". Female visitors would migrate to the kitchen where Mother was busy with her chores to chat with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The dining room which actually was the old kitchen was adjacent to the <strong>\"new\"<\/strong> modern kitchen. Dinner was a family affair at the gigantic round dining table surrounded by high backed chairs and stools. Everyone had to sit down to dinner with grandpa presiding over the meal. Lunch was never an issue because of school.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Beyond the sitting and dining areas were the ten bedrooms altogether, of various sizes. They were furnished haphazardly with antique and modern furniture placed side by side. There were enough bathrooms although we still had to line up and fight over the use of the facility, especially in the morning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Above the bedrooms was the attic room, a treasure house of the old and the new, the valueless and the priceless. Anyone who was taller than <strong>4<\/strong> feet could not stand up straight. I remembered hitting my head many a time when I forgot to crawl or creep. We loved playing hide-and-seek among all the chests and boxes. Now the attic was home to some of the homing pigeons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The kitchen was my mother's pride and joy. Papa had equipped it with all the latest gadgets imaginable and we, the children spent almost all our time here, doing our homework on the large work table and watching our cartoons on Mother's color TV and listening to the music and serial stories on the portable radio.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">My eyes misted as I remembered this old home, now sold to an entrepreneur who intended to convert it into an eco-tourism centre.

He had all the childhood ailments, from which he suffered and recovered without much ado. He strolled past play-school and kindergarten, reveling in play more than study.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It was in primary school that he displayed some strangeness. He got on well with most of the boys but he was particularly kind towards the small and puny, those who were bullied. He stood up to the school bully and class bully.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> He was not a giant, being the average size for his age. They were wary of him, keeping their distance. He did not have to fight them but his posture was enough to make them think twice about challenging him. There was a hidden strength in him that caused bigger sized boys to respect him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Yan-Yan was indeed different. His paternal grandmother, Por-por took him under her wings. She saw in him the tenacity, a trait he acquired from her. She knew that he was special and she promised herself that he would inherit all her skills and knowledge which she had acquired from her paternal grandmother. She plied him with her natural and learned knowledge and he took to them like a duck to water.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">At first, he was afraid of what he could see in the people around him but as he learned the skills to face them, to claim their power and to use them for the benefit of mankind, his fear disappeared. His sixth sense, as his Por-por said, would be his wisdom and strength to use for good, and never for evil. All humans are born with two eyes but he had the sixth sense.&nbsp;<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"This is your gift. Use it well!\"<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">His afternoons after completing his homework and studying, were spent assisting his Por-por when the ancients [the elders] came to consult her about health complaints for which modern medicine seemed to have done little for. These elders trusted Por-por's herbal concoctions and though sometimes bitter, took them without a murmur. Sometimes, he heard her advising them to consult the men and women in the white coats.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">On weekends, Yan-Yan would accompany his Por-por to the jungle to look for herbs. She painstakingly taught him how to identify the myriad trees, plants and shrubs and their medicinal uses. She warned him not ever to destroy the greens of the jungles but to preserve those that he could grow in the garden plot.&nbsp;<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"We have to protect the environment. Be Nature's friend.\"<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It happened that one day, Por-por fell quite ill. Even her own potions could not help her to recover. Yan-Yan sat deep in thought and as he meditated, he had a vision of the plant that was to be the herb to heal his grandmother. He hurriedly went into the jungle and trekked to a plot where he had not ventured before. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There he saw a colourful plant [of seven colours]. He took seven leaves, went home and boiled them. His Por-por drank the soup. He did it for seven days. On the seventh day, his grandmother got up and went about as though she had never been ill.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Por-por smiled. \"Thank you, Yan-Yan. I'm proud of you! You have learnt well!\"<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Yan-Yan smiled, \"Por-por, you are a great teacher!\"<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Yan-Yan continued to go to school and continued to learn his grandmother's profession. He was particularly kind to his friends who were from poor homes. He gave them \"the sixth sense\" treatment so that their energy level remained high. He gave them courage and determination to face the battles of life.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Yan-Yan spent his holidays learning the scriptures in the temple. He also learnt meditation to strengthen his inner resolve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Yan-Yan knew what he had to do in the future.

The house was as silent as the grave. I stood at the front door and looked nostalgically down the empty driveway.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The events of the last week were a blur in my mind. I was too busy that week to reflect on any event. My beloved father had been laid to rest. In that week of loss, I had left all the funeral arrangements to a professional firm. I only had to receive guests and accept their condolences. My stepmother and my step-siblings hanged around, seemingly busy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">My stepmother, Maria whom my father married after five years of my mother's death, treated me with kid's gloves for I was then a rebellious sixteen-year-old teenager. I was too old to be bullied and too rebellious to be tamed. I got on well enough with my step-siblings though we had our differences and petty quarrels. After my high school, I left to study overseas and returned after ten years to learn my father's trade. The ten years spent overseas as an undergraduate, then as a practicing corporate financial figure, had matured me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I bore my father's second family no malice. I returned home as a world-renowned financer and threw myself into my father's company, chalking up success after success. Father built up his business empire on my mother's wealth and his business acumen. Her untimely death was a big blow to him but he buried himself in his work. When he married my stepmother, I accepted it because he needed a wife. When she proved her worth as a businesswoman, he invested in the fashion industry, giving her a free hand to handle this subsidiary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Father's failing health two years before his demise, meant that I handled all the financial affairs of the parent company. Maria was not too pleased with my control but I gave her no reason to question me. I gave her a free rein to run the fashion industry her way. My step-siblings [Mark, Marx and Mari] and my half-brother [Johan. Yes! There was an addition to that union!] whom I liked well enough to ensure that he had the best upbringing and education that money could buy, were members of the Board of Directors. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">They had their own designations in the company which they had to earn on merit. They&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">knew that blood connections did not assure them of safe employment.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The lawyers were coming that evening after dinner to reveal the details of the will to the family. Dinner was a silent affair. Everyone seemed closeted in their thoughts. I did see Maria surreptitiously glancing at me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The two senior lawyers, Mr. Jack and Mr. John, arrived at 8.00 sharp. We were seated in the family room, waiting for them.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Mr. John read the will. In short, I inherited everything -- lock, stock and barrel! There were a few bequeaths to distant relatives and some favorite charities but the bulk was to me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> I was shocked but in a way, I expected it. Father had hinted his intentions on the many occasions when I stole time from work and rest to be with him. I spent ten years overseas. Now that I knew he did not have much years left, I felt a need to spend moments talking to him or just sitting in silence in his presence, enjoying the pleasure of his much-missed company. We did laugh a lot and even had some emotional moments which bonded us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The other members of the family were stunned. Maria stood up and was about to say something when Mr. Jack shook his head. She sat down, clearly annoyed. My step-siblings and my half-brother were agitated and stared at me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I signaled to Mr. John. He cleared his throat. \"There is a second will.\" Maria smiled. She must be thinking that she would be the main beneficiary, not me. Mr. John opened his brief case, took out an envelope and handed it to me. Maria's eyes were puzzled. What now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I opened the envelope, drew out the will, the second will. I read out the contents. I had decided to divide my property which I had just inherited. I had prepared two wills. One was if I should inherit all and one was if my father's property was divided among the wife and the children. Father needed not bequeath anything to his stepchildren but they were loyal to the company and had worked to earn his trust and respect. Any bequeaths to them would be seen as fair. Having explained that, I went on to my \"will\".<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Maria was to inherit the fashion industry subsidiary but not remain on the board. Her children would hold a 8 % share each and be directors on the board. My half-brother would hold a 18 % share and be appointed Vice -Chairman. I would be the principal shareholder with a 58% share and be the Chairman.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Maria kept quiet because she had retained her \"company\" although I knew she disliked not being on the board. Her children got their share too so she should not complain.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">So the one more will had surfaced.

In those days, there were no rules of child abuse and they escaped scot-free. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">To make matters worse, I was sandwiched between a dark-skinned Indian girl with white teeth and a fair-skinned yellow-haired English class. Could you imagine the horrors that haunted my first year in post-kindergarten? My parents just ignored my rantings, protests and tears in the mornings and I had to be in school, rain or shine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">An unforgettable incident occurred when the imp in the class sneaked a black harmless spider down my collar. I was paralysed with fear, my face turned chalk white, my hands and legs trembled lifelessly, I was screaming as though I had been murdered.

I soon grew out of these unreasonable fears: afraid of the dark, sudden loud noises, unexplained rattles and shakes, a shout out of the blue and numerous other silly fears.

There were wall panels covered with watercolor landscapes, engravings and cross-stitch pieces. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Along the corridor leading to the kitchen was Mr Lim, slumped in an armchair.

We bulldoze forests to make way for concrete jungles, depriving many species of the flora and fauna native to their habitats. We dump all types of waste into our rivers and seas, doing irreparable damage to freshwater and marine species. We hunt for sport and use animal parts to cater to our exotic tastes. All our actions are resulting in the dwindling of wildlife. We are losing plant and animal species at an accelerated rate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">what can we do to stop this massacre ? Firstly, wildlife trade should be banned. The authorities should strictly prohibit the sale of animals and animal parts whether it is for medicinal or for other purposes. Forests are habitats for numerous species of flora and fauna. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Dwindling forests means dwindling wildlife. Therefore, forests should be preserved. Promulgating laws alone will not be an effective deterrent. Offenders should be punished. The authorities should invoke the full weight of the law to make offenders cease their illegal trade.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">For wild life species that face the threat of extinction, the authorities should make a concerted effort to conserve them. The creation of forest reserves and animal sanctuaries will prevent animal and plant species from being wiped out. The success of the Sepilok Orangutan rehabilitation Center is Sabah is a clear example of how effective such conservation programs are. Similarly, the establishment of marine parks can protect both marine life and their habitats from being destroyed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Scientific research can single out threats to flora and fauna species and also discover ways of tackling these threats effectively. Monetary incentives such as grants from the government will encourage scientific research. the mass media and television programs like National Geographic can instil awareness in the public on the need to preserve biodiversity. Coverage of wildlife issues should be increased.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The public, too, should play its part.

If we are not vigilant, there could be an upsurge in such incidents.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In my speech today, I would like to outline several measures that can be taken to reduce the number of break-ins in our area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Break-ins often occur when the occupants of a house are not at home. They can also occur due to the carelessness of house-owners. So the first thing to do is to fix grilles and to get reliable deadbolt locks. In some isolated cases, there have been reports about burglars prising grilles open. Installing a burglar alarm reduces the risk of forced entry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The next precaution that should be taken is to avoid providing any telltale signs of your absence. Should you and your family go on holiday or outstation, inform your immediate neighbors. Ask one of your neighbors to collect your newspapers and mail. Uncollected mail and newspapers gives the impression that the house occupants are away. it is always better to inform the police when you are going outstation. The police will then be on the lookout and send police cars to patrol your neighborhood.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Make sure the areas outside your house, especially the porch and the backyard, are well lit. A brightly-lit area deters a burglar from breaking into the house.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Once inside your house, make sure the doors and windows are properly shut. Install peepholes with magnifying lenses to let you see who is at the door without opening it. Have telephones within reach. Place emergency numbers near every phone. Keep your handphones switched on before you go to sleep.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">If you can afford it, you can even install a closed-circuit television to monitor activities inside and outside your home.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">These are some of the ways to prevent burglaries in your home.

Students play truant for number of reasons.

This explains why students who play truant are mainly from the lower income groups. Learning problems is another cause of truancy. Students who find academic subjects difficult or boring would prefer to play truant. Some students who are addicted to drugs or alcohol will frequently be absent. The fear of bullying or harassment may also cause timid students to play truant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">If left unchecked, truancy can lead to juvenile delinquency and numerous other negative outcomes.

I pushed the thought to the back of my mind and went about having my breakfast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">By the time we got ready for school, Dad called out to us. We rushed to the balcony where Dad was standing. The sun was already up and in the dazzling brightness, we could see boulders the size of bulldozers resting at the foot of the slopes. A neighbor informed us that a major landslide had occurred. We rushed to the basement. We saw that rescue workers were already there and were removing buried vehicles from the rubble. The landslide had also cut off the only road to town.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Office workers and school children were left stranded. We were not allowed to go anywhere near the area where the rescue work was in progress. We could not do anything but stand and watch helplessly.

No amount of aspirin could stop the pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When morning arrived, I had to do the inevitable -- make an appointment with the dentist. My dental appointment was at <strong>2<\/strong> p.m. that afternoon, which was just another four hours away. The thought was enough to kill my interest in everything else.

After registering, I walked unenthusiastically towards a chair.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> I did not even bother to look at the other patients. Picking up a few magazines, I tried to read, but I could not concentrate. All I was aware of was the terrible pain. The sight of patients coming out from the treatment room, with large pieces of gauze sticking out from their mouths, only seemed to worsen my pain. One o my New Year resolutions was made while I was fidgeting in my seat. I vowed never to taste another jam tart or take a chunky bite of chocolate in future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When my name was finally called, I staggered into the treatment room. I heard the dentist greeting me, but I could not bring myself to respond to his greeting. The sight of the drilling equipment and the hypodermic syringes only increased my feelings of nausea. When the dentist summoned me to take my seat and asked me to open my mouth, I felt my heart pounding very fast. I was sure that I was going to get a heart attack.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The dentist probed the offending tooth with various instruments. He informed me that it was best to extract the tooth. I nodded and closed my eyes and tried to think of other thing. the next minute or so was one of the most terrifying moments of my life. I grabbed the dentist's hands more than once. At first he was quite taken aback and eyed me suspiciously. Then he warned me that I would have my hands tied if I were to repeat my antics. I did not think that he was joking !<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Soon the pain gave way to a soothing sensation. When the dentist told me that it was all over, I could hardly believe my ears. After paying for the extraction, I walked out of the clinic confidently and headed for the nearest bus stop.

In the past, students who are weak in their studies engage the services of a tutor, one who was an expert in his field of study. Today, it is a different scenario altogether. Tuition has become a major money spinner for many teachers. Almost every student who can afford it go for tuition and parents are willing to fork out huge sums of money just to ensure that their children are not left behind in the rat race or paper chase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The rationale for sending students for tuition is to provide opportunities for students who are weak in certain subjects to catch up. In schools, teachers have limited time to teach students. For example, there are only five lessons per week for subjects like Mathematics and English. The time allotted is certainly insufficient for weak students to understand a particular subject. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Moreover, with increasing paper work and a load of other duties, teaching time may actually be further reduced. Teachers may rush through the syllabus leaving weaker students in the lurch. These students who have difficulty assimilating what is taught may then resort to tuition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Nowadays, due to work commitments, parents stay away from home for the greater part of the day. Parents would then prefer to send their children to tuition classes just to keep them from getting involved in undesirable activities or just to prevent them from idling their time away. Some educated parents may be too busy to help their children with their studies. On the other hand, there are parents who are unable to help their children because they do not have a sufficient level of education. For these groups of parents, tuition is helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Tuition classes, nowadays are no longer confined to small groups of students. Many tuition centers have a large enrolment. It is not uncommon to find tuition classes which have bigger enrolments than classes in schools. In such instances, students cannot get personalized attention from tutors and this defeats the whole purpose of tuition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The authorities should come down hard on such tuition centers which are out to fleece students.

But I did not mend my ways until this incident.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I had just finished lunch at home and I was feeling very bored.

Two months later, tiny rubber plants grown from these seeds in London's famous Kew Gardens, were dispatched to Sri Lanka and Singapore. There, the plants flourished and so not only was wealth and prosperity brought to Malaysia, for the production of rubber is now Malaysia's greatest industry; but also the world's rubber manufacturers are able to cope with the phenomenal demands for rubber in practically every department of life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Synthetic and man-made rubber, which is now being produced on a a very large scale is helping to cope with these demands and may possibly in the future usurp the position of the world's natural rubber.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Today, rubber is indeed man's versatile servant. It serves you in your home. It is found on your radio and television, on telephones, electric irons, toasters, coffee percolators and sewing machines. It is found in the kitchen for the vacuum cleaner and refrigerator. Where is the house without its electric fan containing rubber or the desk that does not show an eraser, elastic band or vulcanized fountain pen ? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There are mattresses made of foam rubber and in colder climates, where is the house without its rubber hot water bottle ? In the garden, rubber has a variety of uses from hose-pipes to footwear. Rice and biscuits -- these on the surface, would seem to have nothing to do with rubber. But, it is because of rubber that the high polish on grains of rice can be obtained. the machine to polish rice consists of an emery cone and rubber blocks. the rice revolves between these two and it is the combination between rubber and emery board that achieves the polished surface. we often eat biscuits with the 'brand' or maker's name printed on the surface. 'Glaxo' or 'Peakfrean' are examples of this. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A printed metal stamp would be impracticable on the sticky surface of the dough of which biscuits are made. It would stick ! Therefore, to stamp the biscuits, a thin sheet of rubber is inserted between the stamp and the dough. thus, the biscuit is stamped through the rubber rather like a carbon copy of a letter. Rubber is used to make our raincoats or mackintoshed as they are called after a Manchester firm 'Machintosh' who, in <strong>1846,<\/strong> bought a patent for vulcanizing rubber, invented by a man called <strong>'Parkes'<\/strong> in Birmingham.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Since Christopher Columbus first saw natives of Haiti playing games with balls made from the gum of rubber tree, thousands of different balls from the rubber, beach ball to the golf ball, have been made out. Further a field from home, rubber is used for furniture and gymnastic equipment. In the cinema, it is used for projectors and cinematograph equipment of all kinds. Even down on the farm, it appears in tractor tyres, milking machines and combine harvesters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Rubber is used when you travel.

Since the war, most modern countries have electrified their railway systems, motor cars have become fast, comfortable and reliable, the bicycle has largely been replaced by the motor scooter. The hovercraft, floating with equal ease over sea or land by means of its compressed air jets, is becoming a useful method of making short sealand journeys. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The nuclear-powered ship or sub-marine can travel on or in the water for months on end-without refueling. The helicopter can hover, take-off and land vertically, in a jungle clearing, on the deck of a ship, or on the roof of a building. And in the sphere of fast air-transport, the jet-engine has revolutionized speeds and heights at which aircraft can travel, and so made the crossing of oceans and continents a matter of hours. While in the grandest sphere of all, that of outer space, the rocket-propelled space-craft can orbit the globe or reach the moon, enabling humans to land there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The advantages of these power-war improvements are obvious. The pace of modern life, internationally as well as nationally, required swift communications. In an age, when even the minor affairs and troubles of even obscure countries are given immediate and world-wide publicity by the radio-telephone, and, television through links such as <strong>'Telstar' and 'Early Bird,'<\/strong> has made it possible for statesmen and politicians to travel swiftly to conduct talks and 'on-the-spot' investigations. Domestic issues, once settled locally, or by the sheer passage of time, nowadays, rapidly become internationally explosive. Without the jet plane, U.N. mediators would be powerless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Industrially and commercially, swift travel is no less important. Personal business deals between, say. <strong>U.K.<\/strong> and <strong>U.S.A.,<\/strong> can be finalized within one day - and with all the benefits of personal contact, and 'off-the-record' discussion. The pressure of time on people who can afford foreign travel and holidays is such that they often have only a few days to relax in different surroundings. Swift travel is, therefore, a modem trend of the tourist trade overseas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> And within a country, tourism is greatly helped by the modern car, or the motor scooter, both as a cheap method of seeing the countryside and also as an advance on the bicycle for the lower income group commuter. Commuting for the rich, nowadays, is even carried out by helicopter; whereas the scooter moves through the traffic jams, the helicopter can fly over them! And who knows what scientific revelations will be made, when man is able to travel confidently in space and see for himself something of the mysterious universe in which he lives?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But modern transport also has something on the debit side, much of this being due to its actual or potential misuse. The satellite, space-ship, or jet plane can all be used for international spying and for releasing nuclear bombs as well as for peaceful purposes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The fast planes quickly transport troops and equipment to trouble-spots, but international friction is increased when two hostile nations make of the domestic issue of a minor country the battle ground of their own ideological disputes. It is a sad irony that many advances in modem transport have been forced on major countries by diplomatic competition and mutual mistrust.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Internally, modern transport has played havoc with many modern cities. It is said that there are as many private cars as taxpayers in Singapore.

Opinions vary particularly between sight and hearing. A person blind from birth has no concept of vision, so presumably does not `miss' sight. It is different for a person who goes blind because suddenly, or gradually, so much is lost; personal independence to a large degree, driving a car, reading and watching television, enjoyment of all forms of visual beauty. Some of these deprivations can be partially overcome. The loss of sight tends to train a more acute hearing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> People will always help the blind in practical ways, and there are many modern aids for the visually handicapped, ranging from braille and books on tape to all kinds of domestic appliances designed for the sightless. Musical appreciation and music making are also open to the blind. Many blind people would grade vision as less important than hearing, since, given help and their own determination, they can live a relatively full life. The obvious drawback to deafness lies in loss of communication, though today there are some marvelous machines which allow the sufferer to learn speech through varied frequencies of vibration. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The traditional method of lip-reading supplements this, so that conversation and teaching can be carried out. The social disadvantage of deafness is that of the impatience of others. Deafness is not at once obvious and so may be mistaken for stupidity. In the modern world deafness can also be dangerous; traffic-sense, particularly in children, depends largely on hearing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Touch, taste and smell are all sources of pleasure, the two latter being important in the enjoyment of food, but they are all relatively dispensable. Their absence can, however be dangerous; the loss of nerve endings can lead to severe domestic burns and abrasions, while taste and smell can detect lethal gases and poisonous substances.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">From the human point of view most people would grade the importance of the senses in the order given in the question. This is not necessarily so in the animal world. Smell or <strong>'scent'<\/strong> is of crucial importance to many animals, who rely on it to detect enemies and to find quarry. Thus it becomes far more highly developed than in humans, since survival may depend on it. For the same reason hearing is of nearly the same importance. The hearing range of animals is much wider than that of humans. Dogs can hear supersonic sounds and react to them at great distances. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Many animals have very limited vision, simply because vision is relatively unimportant. Touch and taste are also of less importance to animals than to humans, though, as with humans, these two senses, combined with smell, have a protective role in warning them off obnoxious and poisonous organic and inorganic substances.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Nobody can ask an animal to grade the importance of the senses, but it seems to be, smell, hearing, sight, touch and taste in that order.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148695","category_id":"85475","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">My perfect future husband or wife<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong><\/span> A popular saying goes, <strong>\"Marriage involves three rings - the engagement ring, the wedding ring, and the suffering.\"&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">If it is commonly felt that marriage is so difficult, why do most people wish to get married? Probably, the instinct to find a mate is inherent in human beings; and I am no exception. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Somehow, I believe that there is someone out there who was made specially for me, and, once I find him, we will fall in love, and get married; and only then will I feel complete. So, how will I recognise my Mr Right? What qualities should I be looking for?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">First of all, I am not looking for <strong>\"Mr Tall, Dark and Handsome\".<\/strong> Character is more important than looks. I cannot deny that I am attracted to good-looking boys, but marrying solely for physical attraction will probably lead to short term pleasure but life-long regret. I have also noticed that handsome boys are often vain and arrogant, which I find most unattractive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> One of the main things that I admire in a man is humility. Such a man will not boast about his wealth, intelligence or achievements, but, instead appreciate other people's abilities and achievements. He will also readily admit when he has made a mistake. Such a man would be a joy to live with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Good communication is the key to any solid relationship, most of all, marriage. I would want my future husband to share his thoughts with me. I want to hear his dreams and to share in his struggles. On the other hand, I will also need someone who will be ready to listen to me, and interested to know what is happening in my life. There should be no secrets between us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Life is full of challenges. We can expect to face failure as well as success; heartache as well as joy; boredom as well as excitement. So, the perfect husband should have a positive attitude and a good sense of humour. He should be witty and say things which make me laugh. The perfect husband would also be one who can see the silver lining behind every cloud, rather than focus on the flaws in every situation. With such a man, I will be encouraged to look at life in a happier and more positive way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Above all other qualities, the perfect husband will be faithful. He must be someone who really believes in that marriage is made to last<strong> \"till death do us part\".<\/strong> He will be totally committed to our relationship, and willing to stay for the long haul, \"in sickness and in health, for better or for worse\"; as couples promise in the wedding vows. The perfect husband would not be distracted by other women; not even when I have lost my looks. He would be a<strong> \"one woman man\".<\/strong> In return, I will also promise my total loyalty and faithfulness to my future husband.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Actually, there are many other qualities that make a man perfect husband material. For example, one obvious quality would be the ability to provide; and, though it is not the most important quality, physical attraction must be a part of the equation for a marriage to work well. However, while it is easy to make lists, finding a man to live up to them will be very difficult. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Furthermore, instead of focusing on my requirements for the perfect husband, I think I should recognise my own imperfections, and set about correcting them.

My mother usually wakes up first. <strong>\"Where is my big girl?\"<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> is her usual greeting, followed by warm hugs and kisses.

It is usually dim sum, my father's favorite breakfast food. This is a jolly family time. My father's jokes never fail to make us roar with laughter. Sometimes, my grandmother will tell my parents the news concerning our other relatives, including their illnesses or the bad behavior. My father will comfort her and try to encourage her to be patient and happy. When my grandmother gets into this mood, I cringe inside because I wonder whether she will mention my misdeeds. Fortunately, my parents are both understanding, and try to keep our breakfast a light-hearted occasion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">My father has two sisters in Bentong, and we usually go to his elder sister's house after breakfast. His younger sister's family will also drop over, if they are free. While the older folk chat in the living room, we usually go out to the orchard and relax under the trees. My aunt and grandmother will cook up a storm in the kitchen. They are excellent cooks, and, somehow, we always find space in our stomachs for the delicious food.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the afternoon, we often go to the supermarket to buy the household necessities. Then, sometimes, we go for a movie. We usually have dinner at the stalls. Sometimes, our relatives will come along for dinner or the movies, adding to the fun. Later, my father will look at my schoolwork.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> He will praise me for my achievements, and correct me gently when he feels I have slacked. Sometimes, when I face difficulties in my studies, such as Additional Mathematics, or Physics, my father will explain the concepts to me. I look forward to this time with him, as I want to do well for my own sake, as well as to make my parents proud of me. When, we have finished, we just chat or watch television.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Actually, nothing very exciting happens on the Saturdays when my parents come home. We do very ordinary things - eating, chatting, grocery - shopping, and revising schoolwork. However, it is not the activities I look forward to but the people I am doing them with.

Selva knew I was an amateur painter and hence, loved all types of paintings such as still-life abstract and others.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It was the beginning of spring when I arrived in Canberra. The temperature was about <strong>17<\/strong> degrees Celsius and though my brother did not require warm clothing, I was all wrapped up -- it was just too cold for me coming from a hot country like Indonesia. The National Art Gallery was located at the heart of the city surrounded by fountains and beautiful rose gardens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There was no entrance charge and the architecture was both impressive and unique. There were many types of paintings on display based on the painters' country of origins, ethnicity and even theme of the painting. The paintings on display were categorised into Asian, Aboriginal <strong>(native Australian painters)<\/strong> and Caucasian <strong>(white painters from Australia, America, United Kingdom and other western countries).<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> I estimated least a thousand paintings on display, a far cry from our own Art Gallery in Indonesia. the painters ranged from the most experienced to the amateur ones. There was even a section where paintings by Art students were on display and I must say, the quality and the sheer imagination of the painters despite being mere students, were breathtaking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I was most impressed by the aboriginal paintings. There is a sad history that surrounds the natives of Australia. When the white settlers mostly from United Kingdom came to Australia in the 19th century, it was inhabited by natives. A violent confrontation ensued between these two ethnic groups. Most of the children of the aboriginals were forcibly taken away from their parents and brought up by white parents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> the adults were taken to settlements where there was hardly any cultural inter-mingling. The children of the natives were known as the stolen generation named such because they were deprived of the opportunity to grow up with their family. Some of the paintings depicted this theme. They were heart wrenching which moved me to tears.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The paintings covered many themes such as landscapes during the colonial period, scenes of mountains, oceans and festivals among others.

It was amazing to see even small children appreciating such abstract paintings. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The price of paintings almost made me faint. They ranged from AUS$1500 to a few million Australian dollars ! It was such a huge display of paintings that I was sure the government must have paid big sums of money to purchase these works of art. After three hours I was tired yet refreshed by the visit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">We later adjourned for tea and pies at a cafe located on the third floor of the building.

I was rather startled when I saw them in the marketplace selling vegetables, fruits and handicrafts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Their necks are elongated and according to one of the women I spoke to, the coil is worn around their necks at a tender age of two or three. The coils, made of steel, are removed when the ladies retired to bed. When asked whether they feel comfortable without them, the older among them smiled and said she did feel kind of naked without the coils!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The younger generation women of this tribe do not appear to appreciate this fashion and many have refused to wear them. the tradition in terms of dress code appears to be dying out though still alive among the older ones. One of the elderly women told us that in matter of decades, there would not be a single woman wearing the coils. Just like many other ancient customs, the process and invasion of westernization is slowly eroding these values, my father said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">We bought lost of handicraft and also dined in one of the restaurants there which looked more like a stall!

Shirley, the kidnap victim, was walking towards her house when she was kidnapped by four burly men in a red van. Two of the men grabbed the poor girl and carried her into the van which sped off immediately. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A neighbor had witnessed this incident who quickly informed her parents and together lodged a police report.

The police were trying all they could to rescue the girl and to apprehend her kidnappers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">That Sunday morning, Inspector James had received a mysterious message at his office. It was sent by mail in a white envelope and written on a plain white A4-size paper. It read:&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The girl is save for the moment. Hurry or she will be raped and killed when the ransom is paid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The message was signed <strong>\"A Friend\".<\/strong> Inspector James knew that what the message indicated could well be true.

It seemed to Inspector James that it must be one of the kidnappers who did not want to be an accessory to murder.

There are already mixers, grinders and cookers. But I would like to see the integration of these machines into one. I imagine a machine where all the ingredients are placed into different compartments. The front of the machine would have a menu with selection buttons. All the user would need to do is to press the button for the meal she wants and the machine who do the rest. The machine would perhaps be a model based on the one featured in the futuristic cartoon show \"The Jetsons\".<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Then, I would like to see the transportation systems portrayed in \"Star Trek\" become a reality One would only need to stand in a 'transporter' and be sent to the place he wants to be.

Yet, the functions assigned to travel as part of education have varied curiously. Before modern times, the greatest travelers were the Dutch, the onwards, the motives behind travel were exploration, military conquest leading to ownership of foreign territories, trade and commerce, and diplomacy. Clive of India, Sir Stamford Raffles of Singapore, are among the great names associated with the old-fashioned object of travel -- colonization and, in the opinion of some people, <strong>'exploitation'.<\/strong> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">So far from learning about their travels, which, in a sense, they were bound to do, whether they liked it or not, early travelers considered themselves teachers -- of an outlook, a religion, and a way of life, which they assumed was superior to what they found, just because in certain respects, it was more materially advanced. The early travelers were explorers, 'empire-builders' and adventurers, despite the incidental benefits they were able to confer on undeveloped countries. Countries which bred travelers believed quite firmly that foreigners were 'lesser breeds without the law', and that the only justification for travel was national or personal gain. The object was to make money abroad, then come home and live<strong> 'as gentleman'.<\/strong> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Typical of this spirit was the 'remittance man' -- the 'black sheep' of the family who was paid to live overseas. \"Deportation\" -- was the sentence imposed in 19th century Britain as an alternative to execution for certain serious crimes. Botany bay in Australia was peopled by such criminals. An important factor in the early days was time; travel, by sailing-ship or 'safari' meant months to an from a destination. Going overseas meant being away a long time - perhaps for good. European travel was the exception, and here, we look at a new consideration, that of <strong>'culture'<\/strong>&nbsp;Italy and Greece are living reflections of ancient classical lore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The 'educated' young man, rich and sophisticated, was not considered completely <strong>'finished',<\/strong> until his classical education had culminated in a 'Grand Tour' of Europe. During this period, he used the languages learned in the schoolroom, and saw for himself the places which had figured so prominently in his earlier studies. with this new background, he became fit for the Army and Navy, or the Colonial and Diplomatic Services. But, he always 'looked down' on the foreigner -- even the European -- as a second-rate person.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The theory of travel in the modern age is totally different, and this is because the attitude of the older countries to foreigners had undergone ad radical change in the last <strong>50<\/strong> years. As nations draw closer to one another, and we all progress to the ultimate goal of a world-community, we tend to look upon all men as of equal value, and we are prepared to learn from them all, however undeveloped their way of life may be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Today, every intelligent person regards travel as an intellectual venture, and goes abroad prepared to learn rather than teach. Not only his means of getting abroad, but also his occasions of wishing to go abroad have undergone radical change within recent years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Today, distance means little in terms of time. The European executive will soon be able to make the return journey to the USA within the day; already the Singapore businessman can reach England within 18 hours. The jet plane, the fast car, the ship, and the railway have made travel for diplomatic, business or military reasons virtually an immediate thing. Travel is, of course expensive but is much easier if the government or the firm pays the bill. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But all the same, it is far from being limited to the rich, or to officials. Today, travel is a function spread throughout the community. Paid holidays help the worker to travel beyond his own country. Perhaps the most important change is that, nowadays, people at every level of the community are meeting overseas. This tends to spread an international outlook and makes for world peace. It result sin a certain amount of resettlement and admixture of populations, which has actual benefit from the education point of view.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Nowadays, few travel primarily to gain education, but education, though incidental, is the inevitable result. Travel teaches climatic conditions, racial customs, religions languages and the social and political outlooks of other nationalities. It helps in racial and national understanding through exchange of ideas; it provides interesting conversation. Inevitable certainly when the mind is tuned and receptive, but not so to the dull and narrow person, who gains to benefit wherever he goes, and therefore might as well stay at home.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148707","category_id":"85487","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Modern methods of teaching<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong> <\/span>The old fashioned idea of teaching was that the children should play a passive part. They were completely in the hands of their teachers, to be molded into a certain pattern set by formal education, and to emerge as school leavers full of facts which, they had all too often learnt off by heart and parrot-woes. Often, none of these facts were related to life. The children were made to absorb them as a sponge absorbs water. this attitude was adequately summarized by Addison in the eighteenth century. <strong>\"What sculpture is to a block of marble, education is to the soul,\"<\/strong> he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Nowadays, such attitudes to teaching have completely changed and, while a certain store of facts must be learnt for examination purposes and indeed as a background to ordinary living, today such facts are not the 'be all' and 'end all.' Each child is regarded as an individual and not as a cypher in an educational machine. The teacher's aim is to develop the full potential of each child. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He must be taught to respond to and to participate in the activities connected with learning and to -co-operate with the teacher so that everything he does is geared to his own life and to developing his control over his own environment. Today therefore, the facts and the subjects studied are secondary to the development of the child's whole personality. Hence, subjects cover a much wider range these days, from technical and practical subjects to current affairs and commerce.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">To claim a child's interest, great importance is placed on purposive learning which means practical work of all kinds for the pupil. Such work must be varied as a child soon becomes bored when one particular activity is carried on for too long. His interest is not stimulated neither is the require skill acquired.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">New attitudes mean new methods. Oral teaching, a time-honored method is still used, but not to the same extent. The teacher must do some talking, but children are encouraged to talk too, to ask questions and to discuss. The teacher has many mechanical aids to assist him in oral work. Language laboratories in which children can both listen to correct speech in foreign languages and record their own efforts, are extensively used. tape recordings of poetry and literature and of plays stimulate a child's interest and foster a love for these things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Words must be supplemented by visual aids which are important. A British child, who has never seen South-east Asia will know it better, if he sees pictures of rice fields of Malaysia or Singapore's colorful harbor. British geography will come alive for a Malaysian child if he can see pictures of the coal-black mining country. Diagrams and charts clarify many subjects like anatomy, science or chemistry. Film strips, from which children absorb facts much more quickly than they do from a book, are widely used too. It is one thing to explain the growth of a plant from a seedling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> It is a much more telling experience to see it on a film taken with a time lapse camera so that in ten minutes, growth spreading over many weeks can be seen. Mathematics too, makes use of visual aids. Problems can be 'explained' and 'Cusenaire' equipment provides models and blocks for measuring, all of which convey more to the pupil than a dull textbook.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In modern teaching, great value is placed on creative subjects such as craftwork, music, dramatics and woodwork. Here, practical work is the order of the day and the child's progress measured by the end product.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Modern teaching includes the body as well as the mind. a child must express himself and have an outlet. Hence, all schools provide facilities for physical education and for a variety of games. Many provide swimming instruction. extra-curricular activities too are considered important. Hence, visits to museums, art galleries, theaters, and public games are organized.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">We have come a long way from the old ideas on education where the three R's or the classics were alone considered important. Now the aim is to teach a child live and to be lived with. As with all new ideas, time will supply the answer as to whether the child and hence the man has benefited.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148708","category_id":"85488","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The world of entertainment<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong><\/span> Throughout history, man has demanded entertainment.

To be 'entertained', we must be content to look, and to listen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Modern entertainment has become a highly organized business, and in most modern countries, is available in bewildering variety. In a big city every conceivable taste can be met, from cabaret to ballet, from radio and television to the opera and the circus, from the <strong>'straight'<\/strong> theatre to the 'Pop Ground', from the cinema to the variety show, and from the comedian to the symphony concert. And where different races. live side by side, as in Singapore, to these may be added the traditional performances of the Chinese, Indians and Malays.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">And what an attractive world this is - especially to young people! There is a glamour and glitter about it all which makes it irresistible. The prominent 'stars', especially, the 'pop' stars, of today become the idols of the adolescents, who imitate their clothes, habits and hair-styles, and dream of becoming famous and wealthy themselves, Generally, this remains a dream, and the humdrum business of ordinary living has to be got on with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> But there are examples of talented youngsters being 'spotted' by promoters and turned into famous, wealthy personalities almost overnight, so young people go on dreaming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Among them, there are a few who, having talent, try to break into the world of entertainment and, of these, a small minority succeeds. The truth is that bitter disappointment awaits the majority of young hopefuls, yet some carry on, and among them are the few who, not only possess talent, but who also have the good luck to be 'spotted'. But even this is not the end of the story. The real problem is not to 'break into' entertainment, but to keep your place in it, and this means not only a good basic training, but also having the originality to produce more and more new material.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The television is an insatiable <strong>'gobbler'<\/strong> of scripts as writers find to their cost and no comedian can afford to put over the same jokes twice. The crux of the matter is that some achieve instant success, and to be sure f a sustained, permanent place in the world of entertainment demands a training, whether in the drama or ballet school, or in the music academy, or with a professional script-writing team. There are no short cuts for the professional. For this reason, many professional entertainers are disgusted by the enormous sums paid to relatively untrained <strong>'pop-groups'<\/strong> - but, of course, the majority of these die a swift natural death, their members returning to the humdrum jobs from which they came.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Another source of anger to the professional is the inequality of reward, which is related to the popularity of the actor and not to the degree of training and skill which lies behind it. A musician in an orchestra will receive a small, if steady wage; a pop-group guitarist perhaps a hundred times as much; a trained stage actor will be paid far less than a more glamorous, but far less gifted cinema star.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Thinking of the average professional in the world of entertainment, one marvels that he is prepared to go on at all; his conditions are such that nobody without a vocation for entertainment would ever consider his life at all. At times, he will be working, and quite well-paid, but there will be other times when he is 'resting' i.e. out of work, and then he may hardly be able to buy food and shelter. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Moreover, when he is in funds, he will be helping his less fortunate colleagues; the theatricals are a generous race. Eventually, age will catch up with him, but, he cannot expect a pension. Those who make a lot of money tend to spend it, and few are able to live in affluence after retirement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Furthermore, the professional entertainer is exposed to many moral temptations from which most of us are spared, and he has to be of strong fibre, if he <strong>(or she)<\/strong> is to be free from the corrupting influence of some of their colleagues.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Beneath the glitter and the glamour lies hardship and heartbreak for the majority.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The promoters, the managers and the impresarios are never poor men, and the entertainer becomes pathetically dependent on them -- especially when his public image is fading. But despite all this, we still have the professionals and always shall -- because the world of entertainment has an eternal, irresistible glamour.

At this moment, both the USSR and the USA are capable of putting men `into orbit' round the earth, who can even leave their space-craft and float in the space. Permanent scientific satellites already carry equipment which feeds back date to the earth. The second revolutionary advance is the speed of air transport due to the development of jet engine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Invented by Sir Frank Whittle, this engine today, powers aircraft to incredible speeds and heights. The 'sound barrier' is broken very easily and high flying reduces air friction, so that crossing oceans and continents is now a matter of hours. The safety-factor has also been highly developed. Air line disasters continually make news, but in fact, the accident rate in flying is very low. For local transport, the helicopter has become an incredibly useful machine. Able to hover, land and take-off vertically, this aircraft needs only a confined space; even the top of a large building or a small jungle clearing will do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The machine has shown its paces in war, and also in the more humane tasks of land-sea rescue, collecting land-casualties and dropping food and medical supplies. Perhaps bracketed with this machine is the hovercraft, land-sea or land by means of compressed-air jets. For short, comfortable journeys, this transport innovation is ideal. Four of them have recently been ordered by Britain for the English Channel crossing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Finally, of course, nuclear fission has helped transport. The nuclear engine can operate for months without re-fueling, with the result that submarines carrying strategic nuclear weapons, can remain under sea almost permanently, and that nuclear sea-transports are independent of fuelling-stops.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Turning to communications, we find a series of similar advances. Perhaps the modern age dawned when the murderer, Crippen, was arrested in <strong>1910,<\/strong> as he left the trans-Atlantic liner in the <strong>USA<\/strong> where subsequently, he was tried and executed. His arrest was due to the radio-telephone, an invention which has been of great service ever since where world-wide instantaneous communication is desired. Nowadays, it is possible to pick up the telephone in Singapore and within a matter of seconds speak to the subscriber in London. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This is achieved by a series of booster radio stations set up at intervals for this purpose. The undersea cable supplements this method, and it is not possible to send pictures by both means. This is a boon to journalists. Internal communication have, of course, been greatly improved. A large office or factory nowadays, relies greatly on two modern methods of communication; that of the intercom telephone system, which enables offices to exchanges notes at the drop of a switch, and the 'public address' system for disseminating news and even <strong>'music while you work'.<\/strong> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The same system is used on ships and at sports meetings, among other places. The last has marked the development of radar, which is really a locating system. Radio waves 'bounced' back from the object located define its position, on a screen. Television is, of course, the best known advance in communication. It has a variety of scientific uses in addition to its commercial use as a news and entertainment medium. Satellites such as 'Telestar' and 'Early bird' now enable television to be used on world-wide scale.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">We live in an age of scientific marvels, which could make for a better, happier world - were their employment confined to humane purposes. But every one of these inventions can be misused, and the reflective mind is saddened by the fact that whereas man is making enormous advances on the scientific front, he is still in the dark age from the moral point of view.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148710","category_id":"85490","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Always Treasured<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong><\/span> Radzi was the first out of the plane.

He turned round and saw his parents, their dear faces shining with pride and pleasure but of his teenage twin sisters - none. There was no sign of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"They must be hiding somewhere - they love to play hide and seek.\"&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He greeted his parents, and raised an eyebrow.

His mother was gushing all over him, not allowing him to say anything but kept on hugging him.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">His father murmured, <strong>\"Let's get home. They're waiting for us at home.\"<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Radzi smiled, relieved to know they were at home. He kept on talking about his tour of Europe and he was rather puzzled whenever his parents exchanged glances. He dismissed them as his imagination.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">They reached home quick enough as traffic was scarce that early morning, it being a non-working day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He spied a lone figure at the door. <strong>\"Why one? There should be two.\"<\/strong> The twins were inseparable but it could be that six years had made all the difference.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He jumped out of the door and as that lone figure rushed towards him, he thought it was Wani but she said she was Wati. So it must be. He really could not differentiate between the two of them and they had fun deceiving him all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"Where's Wani?\"<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"In your bedroom.\"<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"Wani, Bang's home.\"<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He walked into his room and read the words `Welcome Home, Dr Radzi!' Trust his twin sisters to be so dramatic!&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">After a late lunch, Wati invited him to go downstream to their favourite hideout. \"Bang, I wish to be alone with you without Wani. Wani can wait her turn.\"&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">At the hideout, Wati became all businesslike. \"Please, whatever I say, don't interrupt. Just listen, please.\" There was a quiet desperate plea in her tone.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Radzi nodded for it was quite unlike Wati to be so serious, just the opposite of Wani.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In a quiet sombre tone she related what had happened to Wani. A year ago, Wani fell seriously ill and was diagnosed with cancer. Everyone wanted to tell Radzi but Wani begged them not to as he was sitting for his finals and she did not want him to lose all concentration and be so upset. Everyone had to promise and even after his finals, she wrote him to tour Europe before coming home. She sent him photos of her with Wati, smiling, cheerful and healthy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Radzi was stunned and asked in agony, \"How could she? Why did you let her do it? Why? Why?\"&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Wati kept silent. All she could do was to hug her brother, comforting him as he sobbed his heart out. When the tears dried up, Wati held out a letter. Radzi recognised the handwriting.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He took it and walked to the graveyard. Wani went with him, then left him to read the letter and to be alone in spirit with his beloved sister.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"Bang, please don't grief.

I can't but you are one now. Be the best doctor I know. I am proud of you.\" As he read her letter, a strange peace fell on him. It was as though she was beside him, comforting him and holding his hand. She was the elder and he the younger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He looked up and saw her smile. He looked around, saw Wani and she smiled. In Wani, he saw Wati.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He walked up to Wani, took her hand.

Starting with the uniformed personnel down to the fashion conscious, the populace dress accordingly.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Famous fashion designers have often made fashion statements and dictate the fashion trends. Some have managed to maintain a clientele that have remained loyal to the fashion icon but others have moved on to other avant garde newcomers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The legal fraternity has their black and white attire. The policemen are in their blue uniforms. The army personnel are in their typical jungle khaki wear. Each profession is recognizable by the color.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">What about the schoolchildren ? The drab dull dark blue with a white top has a saving grace in that the dark blue can be dirtied and pass muster. But the secondary blue with white and the male dirty green are not that eye catching. Fortunately preschoolers have quite colorful attire if they need to be uniformed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I am all for decent dressing. Of course, I am in favor of fashion but there is a time and place for everything. Some young adults do not know how to dress for the occasion or the place. They do not know the meaning of decorum or respect. If young adults break the dress rule, what can we expect of the teenagers who are still wet behind the ears ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Teenagers should know when not to come in shorts or funny T-shirts. Female teenagers should not be attired in flimsy clothes or short-short skirts for formal occasions. their shoe attire should be appropriate. Flip-flops, unbuckled sandals or dirty sport shoes are no-nos as school fashions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Sometimes, I do not blame these teenagers for their parents are seemingly attired and sometimes we find that mothers are older versions in their daughters' attire. With such role models, is it of any wonder that young ladies fail to see the logic of being appropriately dressed ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I feel that older adults should set a good example to the younger generation. I believe that it is fine to adhere to changing fashion but there is always a limit to being overdressed or underdressed for occasions. You do not want an observer or a fashion editor to say that you look like a Christmas tree or an overstuffed turkey. On the other hand, someone might comment that you did not have the cash to buy enough material to sew that outfit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Nevertheless, there are some mothers and fathers and grannies who are fashionable yet decently clothed. These are the ones to be emulated.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Blind pursuit of fashion is not the way to keep you in the spotlight.

Do you like them or are you wary of them ? To some, traveling alone is an interesting proposition but to some it is a traumatic experience turning into a nightmare.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">On short bus trips, where you just want to get on and hop off after a few bus stops, the people you meet are the daily commuters who are in a hurry to get to work or home. They are not much of a bother, some of them have even turned out to be very useful, helping you with your shopping bags or giving way to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">However, on long haul bus journeys, it could well be a different situation altogether. Sometimes you sit alongside a pretty huge person who takes up more space than she should. To make matters worse, she is apparently not aware that she has taken up your seat space. It is all right if you are as thin as a rake but if you are somewhat nearer her size, it could be a tight squeeze. Whenever this happens to me, I remember a friend who buys two tickets, one for her portly figure and the other for her bag of goodies. sometimes, there are considerate fellow passengers who try not to encroach on your space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Coming to train rides, on day trips, a train journey is quite boring. Co-passengers keep to their seats except for some who come heavily laden and shove all their belongings under their seats and yours as well. If there is not enough space, they hog the table and the upper luggage decks. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Night journeys are normally quiet except when you get a snoring sleeper on the upper deck. If you are a light sleeper, then it is a night of lost sleep and tired limbs.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Riding in a boat is not a norm in urban areas, not discounting the river cruise. For someone who does not get seasick, a boat ride is just like any other means of transportation. However, on long boat rides, it can be rather intimidating when you turn a funny kind of green and blue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Your stomach does a funny churning and you feel like throwing up but does not.

However, the picky taxi driver who refuses to use his meter or travel to a certain place can spoil your day. In another instance, the taxi driver who weaves his way in and out of traffic can put the fear of the Devil in you. On long distance taxi trips, if you are sandwiched in the middle between two passengers in the rear seat, rest assured you are not going to have a comfortable journey. You should have purchased a bus ticket at a lower rate and arrive at your destination an hour late.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">People who are frequent air travelers have strange tales of their co-passengers. some get drunk and become a nuisance as well as pose a danger to other passengers and the craft itself. there are some who reek of body odor or perfume <strong>(Remember the cheap perfume purchased at the duty-free airport shops ?)<\/strong> or even of some food they have consumed earlier.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Then passengers who recline their seats do so a bit too much and obstruct the space of the back passenger.

Your name is Stress !&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>What is examination stress ?<\/strong> It could be defined as a type of heightened anxiety affecting a candidate before, during and after an examination.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It is a common issue dealt with by students throughout their academic life. Stress is a normal human feeling that is part of life and can often serve as a god form of adrenaline. Stress is your mind or body's natural response to what it views as a threat. When threatened, your body triggers a number of physical <strong>(somatic),<\/strong> emotional and mental <strong>(cognitive)<\/strong> reactions. Each category is connected to the other, so anything that can be done to lessen one reaction will lessen the impact of the other two categories.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The butterflies in the stomach, the sweaty clammy hands, the urge to visit the toilet, the weak knees, the unreasonable panic attacks: these are vital signs of stress.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The two types: anticipatory stress experienced while studying and thinking about the ifs, and situational stress experienced during the examination itself, can cause loss in concentration, physical distress and emotional upset. These outcomes could affect performance excellence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">How is one able to diagnose the stress and act on it to maximize performance ? The sufferer notes the triggers that create stress. He charts his physical, mental and emotional reactions to better analyze his ability to overcoming stress.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Symptoms of stress vary from person to person. Some students are mildly affected and exhibit few symptoms, while others experience severe reactions. Physical, mental and emotional symptoms are seen before, during and after the examination. They run the whole gamut from appetite changes to excessive tiredness, stomach cramps, dry mouth, fainting and vomiting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Examination stress is more common than most students realize, and the symptoms are generally the same for almost all students who experience it. Certain people are more prone to stress attacks. Almost everybody feels a certain degree of stress. However, the intense worrier, perfectionist, ill-prepared learner, masters of avoidance, procrastinators are likely to be more highly stressed. Sometimes a vicious circle comes into play.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Examination stress can be a real problem, especially when the stress reaches a height where nervousness takes over and the candidate cannot even focus on the test questions and do his best. However, there are steps you can take to keep stress at a manageable level.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Traditional strategies such as developing improved studying and examination-taking skills can make a significant difference. Stress management and physical health care enable the sufferer to lessen his stress level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Examination stress is often treated using conventional prescription medicine. While there is a place for prescription medication, consideration and caution should be taken regarding possible side effects.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There are also many herbal and homeopathic remedies which can help maintain harmony, health, and systemic balance in the brain and nervous system, without side effects or sedation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In dealing with stress, there are Dos and Don'ts. The many Don'ts include not to be negative or rushed or be influenced by those more stressed than you. The Dos include positive statements, natural breathing techniques and believing in yourself. After all, it is just an examination !&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">On the Test Day itself, be fresh and alert, think of past successes and put things into their right perspective with success visualization.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A little stress helps.

They are ecosystems whose formation and characteristics are determined by water. The major types of wetlands in Asia are mangroves, freshwater swamp forests, peat swamp forests, lakes and river systems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Until recently, people thought that wetlands were soggy, useless land that would only be valuable if they were drained and developed fro agriculture, housing or infrastructure projects. Besides the direct physical destruction, wetlands are also threatened by chemical contamination and other pollutants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Wetlands prevent flooding by holding water like a large sponge. Water moves slowly and this prevents flooding. Wetlands store water during storms when water levels are high. Then, when water levels are low, wetlands release water. Wetland plants have roots planted firmly in the muddy bottom, but with stalks that rise high above the water surface. This can slow down the flow of water. By doing this, they counter the water's erosive forces.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Wetlands clean the water by filtering out the sedimentation. Because of this, wetlands have been referred to as the 'kidneys' of the ecosystem. Even harmful chemicals are converted into useable forms in this cleansing process. Many government are now converting lands into artificial wetlands to filter out pollution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Wetlands are the habitats for a very large variety of plant and animal life. Wetlands provide the breeding, nesting and feeding grounds for may endangered species. Even animals that live in other habitats use wetlands for migration and reproduction. The plant diversity of wetlands provide a breeding site for crabs, prawns and fish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The many diverse products of wetlands generate numerous socio-economic benefits that are important for the livelihood of local communities. Among the many products that are obtained from wetlands are water supply for domestic us, fisheries, forage resources, craft materials and medicinal plants.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Wetlands are also treasured for their aesthetic value.

A pretty young girl sat in front of a telephone switchboard and was busy handling calls. The room was tastefully furnished and decorated. Mat thought: so this is the place I might get to work in; not bad, not bad at all. He checked the contents of his envelope - certificates, reference letters, identity card, resume, etc. Yes, everything seemed to be in order. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This was the first interview he was going to attend after applying for various jobs advertised in the newspapers. He wondered how he would face up to the interviewers when his turn came. Being a recent school-leaver, he had absolutely no experience in being interviewed. He had consulted some older working friends about the correct way to present oneself at an interview, but they gave him contradicting advice that left him no wiser.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The door marked <strong>\"Conference Room\"<\/strong> opened and a young girl, presumably one of the secretaries, stepped out. Everybody turned their eyes on her. She held a piece of paper in her hand and from it she called out a name. Mat held his breath, heart pounding. Maybe this was his turn.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">An unfamiliar name broke the tense silence and the young man next to him stood up, adjusted his tie and followed the girl into the room. Mat and the rest settled back on their seats.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Ten minutes later, the young man emerged. Another name was called. Still it was not Mat's turn.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">After an hour of waiting and watching others getting into the room, Mat was feeling edgy. When would his turn come? He fidgeted about, fiddling his tie and rolling up the corners of his envelope.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He must have started to day-dream because when he heard his name being called, the young girl was standing right in front of him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"Ahmad Nordin, are you Ahmad Nordin?\" She asked Mat, raising her voice.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"Er, Yes, Yes!\" Mat muttered. \"It's your turn now, come.\"<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Ahmad jumped up and and followed her into the conference room.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Inside the room, three men with ties were seated together behind a large long table. They looked as though they meant business. In front of them was a chair on which Mat was indicated to sit. Mat managed to say \"good morning\" and \"thank you\" before he sat down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"Ahmad Nordin?\" boomed the man in the middle. \"You wish to be a sales representative?\"<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"Yes,\" Mat replied. \"I want to give it a try.\"<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"What experience do you have?\"<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"None, sir. But I am a fast learner.\"<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"Maybe, maybe\" the same man commented.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">After this opening exchanges, Mat felt himself answering their questions confidently and spontaneously. He did not feel uneasy at all. In fact he was beginning to enjoy the interview. Soon he was talking cheerfully as though he had known these men for years. Then suddenly the man in the middle gestured to him to stop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"Okay, Encik Ahmad, that's all. We shall inform you as to whether we want you or not. You may go now and thank you.\"<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Mat stood up, wishing that he could stay longer. There were other things he wanted to say. Nevertheless he had to leave. So he uttered \"thank you\" and shuffled out of the room.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When he stepped into the busy street outside, the sun was shining brightly. He squinted his eyes to get used to the glare. The day was hot but the sky was a beautiful blue. Mat felt happy and relieved. He had just attended an interview which he reckoned to have done quite well. He had just cleared a fearful hurdle and he came out unscathed. With a smile on his face he half-walked and half-skipped down the road.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148729","category_id":"85510","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A seaside resort on a rainy day<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong><\/span> Teluk Kemang &ndash; eight miles from Port Dickson town, is a very popular holiday spot. The beach is covered with lovely white sand and the sea is usually calm and inviting here. Furthermore the water's edge does not change appreciably during low and high tides. So a bather does not have to wade far to get to a decent depth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Come Sundays and holidays, the beach is packed to capacity. This Sunday is no different. When I arrive by car with a group of friends, I have to hunt high and low for a parking space. After some time I find one a few hundred meters from the beach. We do not complain for we are lucky to find one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In double-quick time we are in the sea, swimming to and fro and generally having a good time. From the water I can see throngs of people on the beach. Some are standing, some are sitting while the rest walk leisurely around. Some children are making sand-castles and a couple of white bodies are spread out on the beach, presumably sun-bathing. Too bad for them, the sun is hidden behind black clouds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Black clouds! The thought suddenly occurs to me that it is going to rain. As if in direct response to my thoughts, the rain comes, thick and furious. I can feel the sting of the raindrops falling on my bare shoulders. The sea seems to boil under the incessant onslaught of falling raindrops. I can see the bathers, including me, crouching down as low as we can get into the water to avoid the painful drops.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Through the blurring rain, I see people on the beach rushing madly for shelter. Most of the holiday-makers who come here are in their best Sunday clothes. They have no intention of swimming. These people are mainly harried city workers who come here to join in the happy Sunday atmosphere. However this Sunday is not for them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Soon most of them who do not find shelter quick enough are soaked to the skin &ndash; their clothes, hairdo, makeup and all thoughts of a cheery holiday ruined by the relentless rain. They huddle remorsefully under whatever shelter that are available &ndash; in the stalls, in the hotels, under the huge trees, in the bus. Some bravely stand in the rain with their umbrellas. What a pathetic sight they present. The beach is completely deserted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The souvenir pedlars are more prepared for the rain for they cover their wares quickly and effectively with plastic sheets. It is obvious that they have had a lot of practice at this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The speed-boats that take holiday-makers for a ride around the bay for a fee are idle. The drivers sit forlornly in the boats, waiting for the rain to stop.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Those of us in the sea carry on with our fun. The feeling of getting caught in the rain while in the sea is quite invigorating. Water, water everywhere and enough for anyone to drink. All he has to do is to open his mouth, above the sea that is.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Eventually I can feel the waves becoming larger and the wind stronger. In a few minutes swimming becomes impossible as the waves become huge and angry and the wind begins to get cold. I signal to my friends to get out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Emerging from the warm sea into the cold driving rain is like stepping from a warm bed into a refrigerator. We shiver uncontrollably. So we run to the car. It is so wonderful to be inside the warm car but what a mess we make inside the car; sand, water and salt everywhere. I will have to clean the car when I get home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When I start the engine to move off, I can see buses and cars leaving the beach. It seems like these people have decided to go home too. Judging from the intensity of the storm, I reckon it will carry on for a few hours. There is no point hanging around. Still there are many stubborn holidaymakers braving the pouring rain, waiting for the rain to go away till the seaside becomes cheery and sunny once again.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148730","category_id":"85511","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Break time at school<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong> <\/span>I look at my watch. Two minutes to go before break time and the class is visibly agitated. Everybody is restless. Even Mr. Lee our mathematics teacher is fidgeting quietly in his seat, looking outside every now and then.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The bell rings, exploding the subdued silence of the school. I feel a tangible change in mood among my classmates. The brooding atmosphere immediately gives way to an excited chatter of happy voices. Mr. Lee strides quickly out of the class. We run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">We run toward the tuckshop, slowing down every time we encounter a teacher in our path. Teachers are so slow. They block the way and waste our precious twenty minutes of break time.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Nevertheless I am always one of those first at the tuckshop. I order a plate of mee and ladle a generous helping of gravy onto the mee. The thin Indian man sells the best mee in the world, especially the gravy that goes with the mee. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Next I move over to the refreshment stall of the tuckshop and buy a glass of fruit juice. By this time the tuckshop is crowded with jostling pupils all trying to buy their favorite food. i sit down at one of the huge tables in the tuckshop. For a minute or so I am oblivious to my surroundings. What matters most is the delicious taste of mee in my mouth, and the subsequent thirst-quenching feeling of cold fruit juice running down my throat to my stomach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When I become aware of my surroundings again, I can see one of my classmates sitting opposite me gobbling down his food. I look around. the tables are all fully seated. I see heads all bowed down and mouths feverishly chewing. One boy is gesturing frantically with his rice-filled spoon at his friend opposite him. Obviously he is trying to press a point home but I do not think he is having much success except for the bits of rice that keep flying out of his mouth. You should not talk when eating, my mother always tells me. How true it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Somebody nudges my shoulder. He wants me to get up because I have had my meal and he has not. He holds a plate of rice in his hands. I get up.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The din in the tuckshop is terrific. I see some blue-shirted prefects unsuccessfully trying to keep the pupils in line when buying food. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The tuckshop sells many things -- mee, rice, drinks, sweets and other titbits. Money changes hands quickly. the shopkeeper and his assistants are working at a frantic rate. Young boys crowd around, pushing and shoving, trying to buy their food. Hunger is a very powerful force, indeed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Where are the girls ? We have girls in the school too. I look around, Ah, there they are, demurely seated at a table, one table out of a dozen, eating slowly and gracefully unlike the boys who behave as though they have not eaten for days. Elsewhere I see groups of girls standing and waiting for the rush to be over before they buy their food.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Gradually the number of buyers at the stalls peter out and the girls move in. The difference is so great. the girls do not rush. In fact they take their time buying their food and they even help one another in buying. what contrasting sets of human beings they are, the boys and the girls.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A few minutes before the end of break time, the stalls are almost deserted. The mee seller has already packed up. There will be no mee for latecomers. The pupils move out of the tuckshop to gossip in unrestricted areas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">All too soon the bell goes, signaling the beginning of the rest of the lessons. I walk slowly toward my classroom. Nobody runs. Some stall for as long as possible before moving. Like worker ants we make our way to our classrooms.

Bulging waistlines, obesity and clogged arteries are becoming more common as the Chinese continue with their unhealthy lifestyles. Our preoccupation with tasty but unhealthy meals as well as our increasingly inactive or sedentary lifestyles have taken a toll on our health.

As a result, we have a growing generation of couch potatoes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Chinese have to give top priority to ways of keeping fit if they wish to live a disease-free life.

When calorie intake exceeds output, the inevitable is bound to occur -- obesity and an inactive lifestyle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">What we need to do is shed all the extra weight by reducing our calorie intake and by exercising. Choosing nutritious food that is relatively low in calories is a move in the right direction. If we need to go on a diet o weight reduction program, then it is best we consult a qualified nutritionist or dietician.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When buying food, choose products with healthier ingredients. When you eat out, choose dishes that have less fat or oil content.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Exercise is an integral part of keeping fit. Regular exercise not only helps to manage weight, but also increases fitness levels.

He is always the first one to break the ice on any occasion. His witty remarks and jokes would have everyone in stitches.

The food we eat is extremely high in calories and fat, and more often than not, children tend to prefer processed foods over fresh foods. Moreover, more and more people tend to eat out at restaurants and fast food outlets nowadays.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Fast food contains more calories and a single meal at a fast food outlet provides a person with the total number of calories he needs of an entire day.

Children spend hours in front of televisions and play computer games. Many children are not active enough to use up the energy provided by the food they consume. The many conveniences which are available such as elevators, cars and the Internet reduce the level of physical activity. The lack of physical activity means fewer calories are being burned, leading to weight gain and obesity. The lack of physical education classes in schools for children further compounds the problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Obesity has many attendant risks and effects. If you think that the bulging mass of fat under your arms or in your belly, thighs and other parts of your anatomy is the only effect of obesity, then you are sadly mistaken. Obesity is not merely a cosmetic problem that denies you the pleasure of looking smart and fit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> It is a health hazard that puts you at risk of developing various life-threatening diseases.

Factories too are culprits as they emit pollutants and hazardous waste substances either into the air or into the sea. The increasing number of vehicles which emit the dangerous carbon monoxide and green house gases add to the danger we face from pollution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The earth's atmosphere is constantly being exposed to hazardous materials due to rapid development and human activity to advance their lives.

Burning rubbish openly releases many harmful chemicals and gases and thus, should be avoided altogether. many adults themselves are unaware of this.

They no longer live in the wild but amidst human habitats. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">These animals can form very close bond with their human owners and in fact dogs are even known as men's best friend. Dog owners would tell you how their best friend would snuggle up close to them for comfort and follow them everywhere and know well their routines such as feeding time and the time when their owners return from work. Experts say that pets are very therapeutic and can even prolong the lives of human being, especially elderly folk or these widowed and living alone. Even young children and the recluse respond well to animals rather than their human companions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Walking one's dog keeps one in shape. Since these four-legged creatures need lots of exercise to keep them fit and healthy, most do owners have to allocate time daily to walk or jog with them.

Dogs are also kept to provide security for the home front against intruders and robbers. Service dogs and sniffer dogs are used to extensively in the west such as America, United Kingdom and Netherlands among others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Service dogs such as Labradors and Golden Retriever are trained to assist the blind and elderly to help them with basic tasks such as crossing the street, answering the phone, collecting the mail and others.

Today, science is moving rapidly towards a 'chaos' theory which takes into account God's freedom of action plus the predictable results of laws already known to us, and also unpredictable events.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It is interesting that whereas the old scientific determinism either limited to the Creator's function or precluded the necessity of a Creator, or saw the Creator as totally detached from his creation, science today is begin forced into a belief in God. It also moves towards an acceptance that the scientifically unknown area, the God - mankind 'personal' relationship, is not only feasible, but likely. So science has become much more than <strong>'a way of studying things'.<\/strong> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Whether science can get beyond this point is a matter of conjecture. At a shrewd guess, science may well establish the possibility of 'eternal life', without being able to advance any more proof than could the old-time theologian. World religions have always said that such a belief depends on revelation and personal faith, and it may well be the Creator's intention to keep it that way. Faith, at least, would be greatly devalued if it could ever become the subject of scientific proof, whatever that may be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Another answer, again stemming from the 'chaos' theory, is to the co-existence of good and evil. If there is a Creator, it follows that evil, at least as understood by humanity, must have been allowed to enter the world-scene at some point, but deliberately. Redemption from its consequences is another result, and history is the record of the struggle between the two forces. This says science, although leading to apparently random results, such as the little child stepping under the bus, or a death from cancer, is not random at all. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">All the same, it may stem from 'chaos', if this is seen in conjunction with a belief in the indestructibility of the human personality. So, say the faithful, 'God not only creates, He cares', and science today is not disposed to reject this possibility, the two approaches may converge on the same point. The processes of the universe are incredibly diverse and complicated, so why should the possibility of life after death be ruled out ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Such a belief is an essential corollary to any concept of justice in the Creator's character. This is not justice merely in the sense of retribution. The early Jews believed the Creator got so fed up with humanity that He destroyed them in the Flood, but made a fresh start with Noah's family and the paired livestock' Divine justice is part of the concept of Divine Love, which postulated creation, with mankind as it's highest sentient form, as an expression of that love.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">So the great world religions have this at least in common with modern science; there is a benevolent Creator who offers post-earthly life in some other dimension in exchange for the human response of kindness and observance of a revealed moral law. Justice, therefore, moves into an eternal setting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A religious scientist will find no essential disharmony between his or her faith and the scientific outlook. The great questions of life have satisfying, if unprovable answers. Some of the inadequacies of religion, such as early church doctrines of the cosmos, and strictly Bible-based theories of the origin of species, have been corrected by scientific investigation without detriment to the central core of belief.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Where science, or more precisely the scientist, inevitably falls short is in the application of an essentially simple moral code to the complex issues raised by scientific advance. Genetic manipulation is a case in point. The whole question of in-vitro fertilization is highly controversial.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">All that is on the local scale. On the grand scale the Creator may, or may not allow the discovery of a unified theory of the universe which will provide answers to supplement, rather than displace the answers already provided by the higher religions.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148742","category_id":"85524","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Should we be concerned about the greenhouse effect ?<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong> <\/span>First, what is this effect? Ever since the Industrial Revolution began in the <strong>18th<\/strong> Century smoke from fossil fuels, oil, natural gad and especially coal had deposited carbon dioxide in the lower part of the earth's upper atmosphere. The effect of this had been that part of the energy of the sun's rays reflected from the earth's surface had been absorbed by the <strong>C02<\/strong> and by water vapor and returned to the earth in the form of heat. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Thud the atmosphere is behaving increasingly like a greenhouse. The glass allows the sunlight through but traps the heat. The consequence is what is called 'global warming'.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There is a school of thought which says that the result will be a change in the earth's climate, plus an increase in nitrous oxide, methane gad and <strong>FREONS.<\/strong> It is predicted that by the mid <strong>21st<\/strong> Century average temperatures will ride by <strong>5<\/strong> degree <strong>C (9 degrees F).<\/strong> This will result in the melting of glaciers and the polar ice-caps. Coastal waters will ride and inundate many low-lying countries. Food production for an increasing world population will be put at risk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Not everyone, of course, accepts this scenario, though the quantity of <strong>CO2<\/strong> in the lower upper-atmosphere is constantly monitored, and the fact that the level is increasing is not disputed. Whether or not the expected ride in average temperature will happen is another matter. There have been no significant climatic changed for centuries, indeed millennia and, the opponents of the doom-merchants argue, nature has it'd own methods of damage-limitation and self-adjustment. Moreover, there are no present signs of global warming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The weather pattern in Britain, for example, is much the dame ad it wad in Victorian days, or Roman days for that matter. Why should it suddenly change? Coal had always been burnt and before coal, wood and charcoal. Forest fired have always raged. Volcanoes, and explosions such ad Krakatoa <strong>(1883)<\/strong> have always thrown tons of noxious gases into the atmosphere. After that particular explosion a cloud of dust and gas drifted over Europe and darkened the sun for six months - before dispersing naturally. A tidal wave drowned <strong>36,000<\/strong> in the Java-Sumatra area. Nature's self-damage greatly exceeds any possible human contribution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The fact is, however, that many people do take the 'greenhouse' threat seriously, and there is a cross-section of people in most industrialized countries who lobby continuously against the continued use of fossil fuels. Whether they are right, or merely alarmist, only time will tell. However, the fact that <strong>CO2<\/strong> is on the increase is undisputed. Further, it cannot be disputed that the greenhouse effect is a possibility, even if remote. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Nuclear war is also a possibility, though remote, but every possible step is taken by democratic countries to ensure that it will not happen. So, therefore, should every possible step be taken to reduce, even eliminate <strong>C02<\/strong> emissions. There are already agreements in the <strong>USA<\/strong> and in Europe to cut down, or eliminate the use of fossil fuels by certain target dates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The problem is that many countries are geared to fossil rather than nuclear power sources. Supplies of coal, and probably of oil and natural gas, are virtually unlimited. In Britain, most pits have closed down, causing wide-spread unemployment and much consequent human suffering. The coal lobby argues for emission cleansing and a compromise, both economic and environmental, may be possible. It would be cheaper, they argue, than to transfer entirely to nuclear power, whose installations may in any event cause health hazards and even the occasional disaster.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">One optimistic sign is that proponents of all power sources agree that every generation has an obligation to preserve rather than exploit and pollute the planer. The worst culprits in the <strong>C02<\/strong> saga are the old-fashioned heavy industry plants, such as those in the Ruhr, East Germany, and what was the Soviet Union, and the fossil-fuel fired electricity generating stations. Much of the old industrial plant has now been either modernised or superseded, and some countries such as France have moved over almost entirely to nuclear power. That, in my opinion, is the way forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I do not believe that in any event the greenhouse effect would have the dire consequences which have been predicted. Yet it is a risk which we should not take. Modern technology has outgrown the use of fossil fuels, and apart from any possible dangers to future generations, the kind of world to which we commit them should be a clean, wholesome and beautiful world, as the Creator intended.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148743","category_id":"85525","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The causes and consequences of erosion<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong><\/span> Erosion is the eating or wearing away of land features. It is caused by a variety of factors, some natural, others man-made. The consequences can be serious both for the natural world and for man himself.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The natural causes are weathering, water, ice, wind and change of temperature. The changes may be very gradual, sometimes taking millions of years and dating back to the major upheavals on the planet when the earth was very young. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Wind and rain driving incessantly against sandstone, formed originally by immense pressures on early sea-beds and then lifted above sea-level by volcanic eruption or the clash of land-plates, wears the stone back into sand, thus creating beaches along the sea-shore. In the case of harder rock such as granite, surfaces are worn smooth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Weathering also erodes exposed coastlines in temperate zones. Often cliffs and dunes simply disappear over perhaps a short period of two or three hundred years. The sea encroaches, and sometimes coastal villages are lost. There is written evidence of English villages having been lost under the waves.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The sea also plays its part in the erosion process. The Netherlands, facing the turbulent North Sea, have for centuries fought the battle against salt water encroachment due to erosion. Great dykes have been built to exclude the sea, and gradually the low-lying salt flats have been sweetened and fertilized for agriculture and bulb-growing. In another way, the sea also erodes rock fragments by friction due to the tides. The smooth pebbles on northern beaches are the result of their having rubbed together over millions of years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The great ice-floes attached to the poles play a conspicuous part in regulating sea levels. In general, sea levels are thought to be rising, though opinions vary as to the rate. At present, many fear what is called the 'greenhouse effect', i.e. the punching of holes in the ozone layer due to industrial gases and the use of CFCs. Nations are beginning to agree to eliminate these hazards. The result might be the melting of the ice-caps causing a devastating rise in sea levels. This would put much of the land in temperate climates under sea-water.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Slow-moving glaciers also have an effect. Their immense power pulverizes any rocks in their path. The piles of shale at the foot of many mountains resulted from the pressure of glaciers millions of years ago.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Wind is probably the greatest single cause of erosion. Where there is no protection given to the soil, and after a period of drought or intense heat, the soil crumbles to dust and literally blows away. Man himself can either let this happen or take steps to prevent it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Rain, of course, has a dual effect. In some circumstances it can wash away the soil into river beds, where it is carried down to estuaries, often silting them so that they require dredging. Inland, and on flat territory, rain holds the soil together. Yet rain depends on trees and foliage which cause clouds to precipitate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The central plains of North America from time to time become dust bowls, simply because all vegetation has been cleared in favor of large scale, economic cereal growing. The same clearance of rain forests goes on currently in South America in favor of cash crops. Conservationists throughout the world are resisting these clearances, but are fighting vested interests.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The rain forests support a wide variety of animals, birds, insects and plants, many of which can only exist in their present habitat. This is an added reason for resisting deforestation. Sooner or later when the forests have gone the climate will change from not and humid to dry. The soil will crumble and erode.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Tribes dependent on land for grazing and agriculture lose their herds, flocks and food. They become nomads or refugees and are exposed to epidemic and starvation. Erosion can cause much human suffering.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Even in temperate countries large-scale farming is now being discouraged, for the foregoing reasons. In England such farming has meant the destruction of hedges, ditches and trees, aging spoiling traditional landscapes and the habitats of bird, animal and insect species.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Some erosion is natural and inevitable.

The<strong> 'Pop groups'<\/strong> have set the fashion among many young people, for other things too. The long hair style of the modern young man of the West has become almost a status symbol.

How to behave? What to say? Shall I sound or look silly? How to run a banking account or a car? Such questions may seem trivial, but to modern youth, struggling to find his feet in an adult world, they are all important, because youth is, above all sensitive. An advantage of age is that life teaches us not to care too much what other people think, but this is not given to youth and so they are easily hurt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Questions of religion, of morals, of politics worry them, because this age group, or whatever educational attainment is a \"thinking\" group.

This is a world wide trend. In the 'older' countries, this process is steady, almost gradual, except in Europe, where the inhabitants of Germany, Italy and France, and Britain to some extent, had to take bold and swift measures to reconstruct vast areas devastated by bombing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> In the 'newer' cities, the process has been ever faster, and of these, Singapore, which we will examine later, is a typical example. But in all cities, the tendency has been to convert city residential areas to other purposes, and the result has been the proliferation of problems; housing shortage, and the resettlement of large groups of workers to suburban areas; the social changes involved in such moves, and so on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Generally, the residential areas in the centre of cities have become neglected, giving rise to overcrowding and the creation of slums, while the wealthier professional and managerial classes have steadily moved out to suburban or country houses. So, whether the changes have come about through government policy or were made necessary by war-time destruction, they have been changes for the better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">If a modern city is to play any real part in the modern world, its central areas must exclude dwelling places, except perhaps those which are preserved for historic and cultural reasons. The needs of civilized life have to be met, and there simply isn't room unless 'skyscraper' blocks of flats are built - and on the whole, these can be built in suburbs, when there is pressure on space, as in Hong Kong. Secondly, land values in the centre of cities are very great, and rents therefore, become uneconomic, or have to be subsidized by the government.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> It is not difficult to see why these land values are so great when the competition to build 'at the centre of things' is so great. The list of the various kinds of public buildings, all competing for space, is enormous. To quote but a few, space has to be found for government buildings and offices, police and fire stations, hospitals, office blocks, shops, sometimes factories, hotels, a wide variety of places of amusement, churches, car parks and garages, museums, schools, universities, art galleries, and a hundred others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The result is that the government, or property speculators, buy land and housing property, demolish the house, and erect some kind of public or commercial building in their place. An acre of land in central London can, for this reason, be worth more than million pounds sterling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">At the same time, it is realized that you cannot run a large city, unless the workers are there to run it. or near enough to commute by bus, train, car or bicycle. So the suburbs expand - either upwards or outwards - and the position is reached that the city's ever-widening circumference has become a mixture of older and larger houses, new industrial developments, and new blocks of flats, or re-housing areas, built by the private speculator, built and subsidized by the government as council houses. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Unless architecturally planned as<strong> 'satellite townships'<\/strong> such areas soon tend to become depressing warrens of 'living units', utterly featureless and lacking even the 'character' of the old-fashioned slums. But this is only of the problems attending on a re-housing area. New facilities in the home mean changed ways of life. The lost 'community spirit' has to be re-created. Clubs, churches, temples, shops and sporting facilities have to be introduced, if the new area is to have any individuality, if the older people are to be saved from boredom and the younger people from delinquency. Internally, there are<strong> 'teething troubles'<\/strong> in the early days. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It is not only the housing shortage in a modern city, which is the problem - it is the featureless house in the featureless area.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The age-long housing problem in populous Singapore has been solved by the Government in recent years.

It is because of this that men have realized their value and have taken steps to preserve them and to prevent their wanton and useless destruction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">From the primitive days of the wigman, the house on stilts or the African but, wood has been the basic material used for men's housing to provide shelter from the animals. The wigwam and the African hut were built round a frame of timber. The elaborately attractive black and white houses of<strong> 'Merrie England'<\/strong> in the sixteenth century depended on wooden frames. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">even today, when steel girders from the frameworld of our huge modern buildings like those in the Raffles City in Singapore or the sky-scrapers of New York, wood still forms an important part of the smaller modern houses. Soft woods of all kinds are used fro frames and doors and a variety of hard woods for furniture.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">From earliest times too, wood has played a large part in transport. A rolling tree trunk, very probably showed primitive man the possible use of the wheel, perhaps as important a discovery as that of fire. In the earliest days of the automobile, wood was essential in its construction, but even before that, trishaws, carts, carriages and wagons, all made of timber enabled man to move from place to place overland.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Men were equally dependent on wood for crossing water ad through all the staged from the hollowed-out log and the small boat built round a wooden frame right up to the first great sailing ships which first crossed over oceans, all means of transport were wooden-framed and wooden-walled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Another very important use of forests is a modern one . This is the cutting up of logs and timber for use in the making of paper, particularly the kind of paper on which our daily newspapers are printed. The logs of wood, when cut, are ground up by hue machines and are turned into wood pulp. This, then undergoes certain chemical processes and paper is the end product. When we realize how much daily news-print the world consumes, we can see how great is the need of timber for this purpose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As well as producing timber, certain forests provide important oils such as turpentine from the pine forests of North America or palm oil from the palm forests. Olive oil is produced from the olive tree. There are other products too. The American sugar maple provides sugar from its sap. Flock, for mattresses is produced by the forests of huge cotton trees in West Africa. Equally these same African forests provide the necessary shelter under which the cocoa bean can grow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Forests also prevent soil erosion. They protect it from winds blowing it away and form water washing it away. Forests, too, revitalize the soil and because of the addition of humus and vegetable matter, it does not degenerate and become barren. They also attract rain-clouds and in places where they have been cleared, deserts are likely to appear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Many wild animal and small insects find shelter under the protecting branches of forest trees. A wide variety of climbing shrubs, flowers and creepers are also protected by them. Forests too, whether the tropical ones of South-East-Asia; whether the sweeping miles of north American pines or whether the softer deciduous forest of Europe provide men with beauty. A tree, of whatever kind is a wonderful of nature.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It is because of the importance of forests that they should be preserved. In 1919, after the first great war, the wood shortage in Britain was very acute, because so much had been used in the war effort. The Forestry Commission was therefore, set up. This is a body which buys old woods and land, that is at present bare and turns them into modern forests using the latest scientific knowledge and equipment to help in this purpose. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The modern forester grows his trees just as the farmer grows his crops or the gardener, his vegetables. He plants and then thins them and finally, when they are fully grown, he cuts them down for timber. He always replaces the felled trees with young ones. In reforestation, natural trees must always be grown. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Oak tree which is indigenous to England would not grow in Malaysia. neither of course, do palm trees flourish intemperate climates.

Being flat, it therefore had edges, precipices in fact, so, wide travel and exploration was discouraged, and none by the most intrepid would venture far. Religion especially Judaism and the mediaeval Christianity rooted in Jewish concepts, taught this cosmology as a religious fact and banned all scientific research based on independent thought. It was believed that the world was God's -- in the sense that he discouraged interference and undue investigation, all knowledge necessary to man's salvation being contained in the Bible. Knowledge, therefore, belonged to the Church. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Men died at the stake to contest this assertion. But it was the Renaissance which set thought free. Galileo pronounced the earth round. the door was open, and science struggled free from religion. Thus, the beginning of man's conquest of nature came about, and it was not until the <strong>20th<\/strong> century, well after the Darwinian theory of evolution has been fully accepted, that science and religion came to terms, that the enlightened began to realize it was a case of 'both and' rather than 'either or.'<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But whatever knowledge was groped after the Renaissance, such knowledge had virtually no practical application, until the 18th century in Britain, which marked the beginning of the scientific revolution. This was because there was virtually no such thing as systematic scientific research.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> From times up to Watt's steam engine, applied science was almost non-existent.

To do so, they generally used nature's methods, which are drying, parching and fermenting. Parching is the most natural method, but for many thousands of years, others have also been used. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Direct fermentation of liquids, usually by the introduction of yeast, has not only preserved liquids but also enhanced their quality, the same of course applying to salting. Smoking has preserved, and sometimes improved both fish and meat. Hickory wood is generally used for the fires, and natural juices are contained by a slight coating of wood creosote.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It was not until recently that the causes of rottenness were understood, these being the reactions of bacteria, moulds, yeasts and micro-organisms. Some fermentation and moulds are, of course, necessary in the production of food and drink; moulds, for example, being used in cheese-making. But the real 'breakthrough' in preservation against the causes of rottenness came, when it was learnt how to deal with the micro-organisms present in all foods and drinks, and which react chemically over a period to produce unpalatable or poisonous food or drink. There are three basic methods.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Firstly, food may be preserved by cooling or freezing, to a very low temperature when long-term preservation is required. This was originally done by packing in a mixture of salt and ice; today, cold storage is big business and refrigeration is a highly-developed science. 'Dehydration' may be bracketed with this method, as the principle involved is the same, namely to suspend the operation of bacteria which requires normal temperatures for chemical reaction. This is why reconstituted eggs cannot against dehydrated, and melted ice-cream refrozen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> the second method of destruction is by heat-processes, which destroy all the bacteria present in food and drink. This process is used before canning foods in hermetically-sealed containers, great care being taken not to allow the foods or drink s to become re-infested after cooling and before canning. the third method is to preserve by the addition of chemicals, which control or destroy bacteria. this is merely a follow-up of the old systems of salting, smoking and candling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Eventually, the method of 'cold sterilization' is expected to supersede most of the others; this amounts to exposing the food-stuffs to ionizing radiation.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Today more than mere food-preservation is sought by the consumer, and for this reason, processes are becoming more and more sophisticated. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Quality, economy and convenience are sought by modern man -- especially modern woman -- convenience is important, the 'ready-cooked' meal is popular, while, in Western, or 'Westernized' communities, goods do not sell easily if they lack color, a good appearance, natural flavor, the right texture, and are free from defects.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148749","category_id":"85531","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Science in the detection of crime<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong><\/span> Much to his housekeeper's disgust, the great fictional detective Sherlock Holmes carried out scientific experiments in his Baker street rooms in the cause of solving crimes.

Fingerprinting was invented in Great Britain by Francis Galton and has been of fundamental importance in detection for decades. Some countries fingerprint their whole populations, though others, Britain included, regard this as an infringement of personal freedom, and restrict fingerprinting to those accused of a criminal offence, or to those who are screened for certain security categories. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">science has greatly enhanced the efficiency of this system.

Taped interviews today now go some way to overcome this abuse, though even tapes can be falsified.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A good deal of crime detection and prevention has been privatized in recent years. some countries allow firearms to security guards, others, such as the UK, do not.

Later Bleriot, a Frenchman made history by flying <strong>22<\/strong> miles across the English Channel in a biplane. Between <strong>1900<\/strong> and <strong>1914<\/strong> several countries had made serviceable aircraft, mostly biplanes, gradually overcoming design problems, increasing wing-lift and power, reducing weight and thereby increasing fuel capacity, ironing out facets of maneuverability, and adding both height and speed potential.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> But <strong>pre-1941<\/strong> aircraft were scarcely more than toys; nobody trusted them for travel purposes, range was severely limited, and as freighters they were not worth considering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It was the outbreak of first World War which gave a tremendous impetus of flying, and the potential of aircraft as weapons were swiftly realized.

As a result, Billy was lonely and bored.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Billy craved attention. He mixed with the wrong group of friends and started playing truant. Soon, he started taking drugs. When his parents came to know about Billy's behavior, they tried to make Billy turn over a new leaf. However, their efforts proved futile.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Soon, Billy was on the wrong side of the law. He was hauled up by the police at a nightclub. Billy was caught for being an underage nightclub patron and also for taking drugs. Billy's devastated parents took him to a doctor. On the doctor's advice, he was enrolled for counseling sessions. All their attempts to reform Billy were to no avail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Billy ran away from home at the age of <strong>17.<\/strong> To support his expensive drug habit, he became a drug pusher. Soon, Billy became a hardcore addict. His impoverished appearance and dirty attire became telltale signs that gave him away. His heavy dependence on drugs took a toll on his health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">One day, Billy became very ill and had to be rushed to hospital. After several tests, he was diagnosed with AIDS. Billy knew that his days were numbered. On the spur of the moment, he wanted to go home and apologize to his parents. He knew it would break their hearts to see him in the condition he was in. However, he could not find the willpower to break away from his life of crime despite his parents' pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As his dependence on drugs grew, he fell deeper into crime. Robbery, housebreaking and extortion were added to his list of crimes. High on the wanted list, Billy began a hide-and-seek game with the authorities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">One day, Billy was waiting for a potential client. He was in possession of dangerous drugs. Acting on a tip-off, a police team arrived and arrested Billy. The High court imposed the capital punishment. Before he was sent to the gallows, Billy met his parents. As he said his final farewell, his last words to them were 'crime does not pay'.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148752","category_id":"85534","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The matriarch and the family secret recipe<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong><\/span> It was the hundredth anniversary of the foundation of SMK Shansi set up by philanthropists of major races in the community: a centennial not to be missed.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The school held a charity dinner to collect funds to maintain an on-going fund to restore and maintain the school.

Repairs are also needed to replace the electrical wiring which are years old and could pose danger to both building and people. On top of that, basic facilities in the school are lacking.

Today is World Health Day and today I am going to talk on the benefits of drinking water.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Water is ranked second to oxygen as essential to life. A person can live for only a few days <strong>(only three to seven days)<\/strong> without it. In the human body, water makes up <strong>60<\/strong> to <strong>70%<\/strong> of body weight and is important in numerous bodily processes and functions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Every person loses approximately <strong>2.5<\/strong> litres of water per day through urination, perspiration, respiration and bowel movements. Very few people replenish this loss.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The health benefits of drinking water are many and varied. We cannot and should not understate the importance of drinking water.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>First,<\/strong> water revitalizes the skin. The skin is the body's biggest organ. If you are dehydrated, your skin suffers. Water is nature's best moisturizer. Drinking sufficient water rehydrates your skin from inside. With age, skin tends to become drier, so drink more as you age. Do tell this to your parents and grands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Second,<\/strong> water rehydrates your body. Sunken eyes or dark circles are a sign of being drained of fluid and severe dehydration. Waste products that are normally washed out of the body are left in a higher concentration in the throat and mouth. The bacteria that builds up <strong>(other than poor dental hygiene)<\/strong> can lead to bad breath.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Then, one main cause of constipation is lack of fluid in the intestine which slows the free flow of the bowel.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Next, blood carries oxygen to the muscles. If water levels are low, you could develop muscle cramps because the process of oxygenating the muscles is inefficient.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The conditions above can be avoided by drinking adequate amounts of water daily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Third, water recharges your mind. A healthy mind is just as important as a healthy body. How many of you feel a lack of concentration on a hot day? Low concentration levels could be due to a dehydrated liver unable to eliminate toxins, causing sluggishness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Headaches start in the mind and headaches are often a sign of dehydration. The brain is made up of 85% water, so before reaching for a headache pill or 2 Panadols, try a glass of water instead. It could well be the cure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Fourth, water detoxes. Detoxing is valuable for the body as it cleanses and rids the body of toxins which are present in the air we breathe, the foods we eat and in many drinks. The body stores these excess toxics as cellulite or oily patches. Toxic overloads can lead to headaches, skin eruptions, constipation and that sluggish dull feeling in the morning. Using water to detox, eating a healthy diet and exercising&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">sensibly boost the immune system and give you lots of energy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Finally, drinking cool <strong>(not cold!)<\/strong> water after intense physical activity reduces the body temperature and replenishes water lost through natural perspiration. The body's temperature rises above normal during exercise. A loss of only <strong>3%<\/strong> of your body's water content causes a <strong>10%<\/strong> drop in strength and an 8 % loss of speed. Such losses reduce athletes' performance and records. Hence it is important to drink more&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">than the recommended minimum during intense exercise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">How are we to know that we need water? Thirst is your best indicator. The thirst mechanism is one of the most powerful and sensitive of all the body's regulatory mechanisms. Listen to it. Be sensitive to its needs. The recommended daily intake of water for an average adult is <strong>2<\/strong> litres or <strong>8<\/strong> glasses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">You could try these tips to monitor your water intake. Take water breaks instead of coffee breaks. Choose decaffeinated coffee and tea. Drink water before scheduled physical activity during and after it. Keep a water bottle beside you. Spice up your drinking water with fruit juices or add a slice of lime or lemon to flavour that cool drinking water.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In conclusion, let us be concerned not only with monitoring our water intake, we have to be just as concerned about the water we consume - its quality and safety.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148754","category_id":"85536","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Nutrition for you and me<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong> <\/span>The sun's hot rays scorched the parched earth.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Maniam stared unseeingly at the withered dying plants, looking but not seeing. Months of hard work had gone down the drain. The vegetable patches were starved of water, the land was strangely silent.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Even the animals were quiet, having lost the desire to make even the slightest noise, exhausted to the bone by the unrelenting heat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Such a climatic catastrophe had never appeared in all the years that Maniam first ventured into vegetable planting. Together with his best friend, Ah Seng who happened to be his schoolmate, they applied their academic qualifications in the field of agriculture and business to farming. Nature was there for the taking - to be man's partner in bounteous returns.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The first two years were difficult times. However, they managed to make ends meet and they enjoyed the great outdoors. Besides they were their own bosses, being equal partners. In addition, they were not interested in making millions, they did not want the stress of the rat race, neither the thought of making millions for others and being paid pittance. They worked when they liked, and they had fun when they liked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It was the third year when things started picking up. Profits came, slowly but surely. With the current fad of healthy living, where the health fanatics ate more greens, Maniam and Seng were delirious with great expectations. Nature was kind and merciful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Alas, their happiness was short-lived. The weather became erratic. Some days it rained that the plants were flooded out. Some days, it burnt until the plants were parched and dried. It was a nightmare but the situation was under control. They could still plant, they could still harvest, the farm was still surviving and fortunately, there were the profits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Then, the drought had to descend with all its fury on the vandalized land. It had not rained for months. The lakes and rivers had dried up, the reservoirs were almost empty. Water rationing was in force.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Seng applied his engineering skills to extract water from the thirsty earth. He did whatever was humanely and scientifically possible but it seemed as though the elements had deserted him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Maniam tried to use all his business contacts to get financing and buyers but they too were facing financial setbacks.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Somehow, by a quirk of nature, the hot days turned cooler and the rains came. The rain fronts seemed to have come from nowhere and the air was dense with moisture. Maniam and Seng were relieved but their relief was cut short.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The rains were different from the rains of the past. It did not rain to please mankind, it rained to please no one, not even the elements. Earlier, just a year ago, they had to contend with heat, sun and drought, now they had to be enemies with water. It rained and rained.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The whole land turned into raging swirling waters of mass destruction. The dramatic change was beyond imagination. One minute it was scorching hot, the next second, it was a Waterworld. The waters showed no mercy. Maniam and Seng had an instant swimming pool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Seng and Maniam could only look at each other. Twelve months ago, they had the sun for company, this time, they had the water as their enemy. It was fun to have them in small doses but when they were in excess, they were monstrous agents of destruction.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The two friends decided to allow nature to reign supreme again as they resigned themselves to the fury of nature one more time.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148755","category_id":"85537","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Online shopping<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong><\/span> No one could really fathom how Mack and Zack could be such good friends. They were direct opposites in every way -- from the top of their heads to the tips of their toes. They were labeled the inseparables by their mutual friends.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">They first met when they were in Form One. It was not one of those thunderbolt meetings but ordinary and mundane. Both were eyeing the second seat in the middle row in the classroom. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Both rushed for the chair but a bumbling giant of classmate plumped himself into it. So they looked at each other, shrugged their shoulders nonchalantly and placed themselves on either side of the giant. However, the class teacher summarily rearranged their seating positions. As fate would have it. Mack and Zack found themselves seated beside each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Physically, Mack was thin and lanky. He looked undernourished but actually he could eat. On the other hand, Zack was plump and stout and ate like a bird.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Mack was a bookworm and a star student whereas Zack was an easy-going student who managed to scrap through his schoolwork. Mack enjoyed tutoring Zack and Zack found himself responding well to Mack's tutoring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Mack was a dreamer and was quiet and reserved unlike Zack who was boisterous and outgoing. Mack listened while Zack chattered. Mack could be seen laughing quietly with Zack clowning around and the life and soul of any gathering.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Despite their differences, there was an invisible rapport between them. How did it happen that between these two teenagers there was a silent unspoken understanding ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It happened that while they were both in Form I, a bully of a classmate made Zack's life a misery. While everyone steered clear of this big bully, Mack was the one who made mincemeat of him. Though thin and lanky, he packed a powerful punch and the bully stayed well out of his fists. Zack adored Mack and they were inseparables since the day Zack was \"saved\" from being pulverized to a pulp by the bully and his like-minded friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Soon news of Mack's fighting spirit spread like wildfire and many wanted to be his buddies. But, Mack stayed a true friend to Zack. They continued to be friends even when Mack chose to be in the science stream while Mack decided to be practical and opted for the arts. Not being in the same class did not prevent the two inseparables to continue to be inseparables.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It was a friendship where looks, interests, abilities and distance could not put asunder.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148756","category_id":"85538","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The environment through my eyes<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong><\/span> Grandmother Choi was a true-to-life matriarch Her word was law in the household.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Her daughters-in-law kept out of her way, if they could escape her eye.

Just a handful, just a cup, just a pinch and it was all just right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">However, Mother told me that there was one recipe which no one knew anything about.

Misuse and overuse of earth's resources can cause negative effect on the ecosystem.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There are many human activities that can and have caused negative effects on the ecosystem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the first instance, there is the deforestation or clearing of natural forests. In the name of development, land is cleared for construction projects, mining, timber production, building of dams and draining of wetlands&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Such activities result in flash floods, landslides and soil erosion. Wild animals are robbed of their natural habitats. With less trees, there is an increase in carbon dioxide but a decrease in oxygen production.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Man's need for food keeps on escalating. In the second instance, farmers use excess chemical fertilisers: nitrate, phosphate, herbicides and pesticides.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">What follows next is the excess fertilisers are washed into lakes and rivers, thus stimulating algae growth. At the same time, the water quality in these waters is affected and fish die. Overuse of herbicides and pesticides produce toxic that affects the food chain which filters into agro-based food products, ending up in the human body.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the third instance, man's switch from agricultural to industrial based economic activities, from horse drawn carriages to motor vehicles, and open burning have produced various air pollutants.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the air there is invisible carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, oxides of hydrogen, carbon particles, lead and carbon monoxide. We get smog<strong> (eg. the yearly haze)<\/strong> and acid rain. Then we experience heat because of the greenhouse effect and ozone depletion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the final instance, man dumps domestic and industrial waste. In addition, we have an improper and inadequate sewage system.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The ecosystem <strong>(the air and the waters)<\/strong> is endangered with chemical-polluted waters or micro-organisms that are dangerous to health as well as emitting foul and stale smells.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">What can we do to ensure a balanced ecosystem ? Concerted effort is needed to develop and manage a viable system to protect the ecosystem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">First, there should be enforcement of environmental laws. Implementation of laws to control pollution eg. Environmental Quality Acts <strong>1974 (water quality)<\/strong> and <strong>1989 (waste treatment)<\/strong> should be strictly enforced, without fear or favor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Second, there should be the preservation and conservation of the forest. Where deforestation has taken place, it should be followed by reforestation. In areas where land has been laid bare, there should be preservation of soil through the use of good farming techniques.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Third, further to agricultural policies, there should be biological pest control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Next, every citizen, from the young to the old, should be educated on the benefits and ways of recycling, reusing, reducing and renewing in and of the environment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Last, but not least, technology has to be stringently and systematically applied to the ecosystem. There should be catalytic converters to clean up the gases released. There should be more people using unleaded petrol and even better, biofuel. There should be more sewage treatment plants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In conclusion, knowing about the abuses of the ecosystem while implementing steps to ensure a balanced ecosystem is not enough.

Nutrition is the process by which living things receive the food necessary for them to grow and be healthy.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">We associate food with nutrition. Food is needed to maintain health, as a source of energy and to carry out life processes such as breathing, growing, excreting and reproduction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When we think of food, we think of it in terms of its calorific value. The calorific value is determined by the calorimeter and defined as the energy content of food. Food energy is measured in calories <strong>(cal)<\/strong> or kilocalories <strong>(kcal).<\/strong> One calorie is equivalent to <strong>4.2<\/strong> joule and one kilocalorie to <strong>4.2<\/strong> kilojoule.&nbsp;<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There are factors that would affect the calorie requirements of humans.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>The first factor is sex.<\/strong> Males generally need more calories than females because they are more active than females. Active females would definitely need more calories than a male who does no exercise at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>The second factor is body size.<\/strong> a bigger body size requires more energy because there is more weight to support.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>The third factor<\/strong> is the physical activity of an individual. A person who carries out more manual work needs more calories than an office worker who does more sedentary work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>The fourth factor<\/strong> is the state of health of the individual. Sick people need more energy than healthy people to fight against diseases and repair damaged tissues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The fifth factor sit he surrounding temperature. People who live in cold climates need more energy to maintain a constant body temperature.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Good nutrition intake results in good health. The individual is energetic and healthy and all his basic life processes function smoothly. He does not fall ill easily, does not catch the flu when he comes in contact with a person who has the sniffles and is usually cheerful and good natured.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">On the other hand, should a person indulge in poor nutrition intake, he may face immediate health ailments and face more serious health problems in the long run. Poor nutrition intake means not having a balanced diet of sufficient proteins, carbohydrates, fats and vitamins. he may consume too much red meat and too much fats. he stays away from vegetables, fruits and drinks very little water but drinks too much soda.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Firstly,<\/strong> a person with bad nutrition intake may suffer from malnutrition. He lacks proteins and vitamins. He may suffer from undernourishment, scurvy, rickets and even night blindness. His body weight drops. he becomes thin and lethargic. He may have a pot belly, and dry skin. Vitamin deficiency can be seen in swollen and bleeding gums, soft bones and poor vision.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Secondly,<\/strong> poor nutrition can result in anorexia nervosa. It is an eating disorder where a person limits eating and weighs at least 15% less than his ideal weight. He fears being fat. the victim is thin and depressed. In very serious cases, the victim dies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Thirdly,<\/strong> Poor eating habits can result in obesity. Excessive eating results in excess fat being stored in body parts like the abdomen, buttocks and limbs. The person looks fat and sometimes develops low self-esteem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Next, when there is excessive intake of salts, fats and cholesterol <strong>(in food like egg yellow, meat, prawns, cuttlefish),<\/strong> the person may develop high blood pressure, the silent killer of this era. Then, there is the diabetes mellitus which is a metabolic disorder. High sugar intake may result in this modern disease of luxury living. These two diseases can lead to stroke, a debilitating condition. In addition, another is heart disease or heart attack caused by arteriosclerosis which is cholesterol accumulation on the inner walls of the arteries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Whatever one's span of life, short or long, one should maintain a healthy lifestyle. as far as it is humanely possible, one should eat healthily and sensibly to ensure good nutrition.

The businessman regards the Internet as a modern effective tool for business transactions. Online shopping is the act of purchasing products or services over the Internet.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Let us compared online shopping to traditional or conventional shopping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Online shopping, particularly during a festive holiday season, alleviates the need to wait in long lines o search from store to store for a particular item. Conventional shopping in the brick and mortar building entails leaving the home to jostle with the traffic, crowds and long queues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">What are the advantages and benefits of online shopping over conventional shopping ?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">First, there is the convenience of being able to shop <strong>24<\/strong> hours a day for any type of product imaginable. The ability to shop from home allows many people <strong>(the elderly, the disabled, young mothers)<\/strong> to still purchase the products and services they need. Then it is more comfortable, doing it in the comfort of your home, instead of running around in the store. Online shopping allows you a 24\/7 shopping time. you can surf the Internet at any time of the day and buy your goods. You can find and buy products from all over the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Second is that goods are often cheaper as the seller does not have the costs of running a shop. You have the opportunity to compare as many products and prices as you want without having to spend the time and money to travel between several different shops. You get cheaper deals and better prices with discount coupons and rebates thrown in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Third, you will also be able to read reviews y previous buyers and select your purchases with additional information from satisfied customers. The photographs and illustrations help you choose and recommendations from others help you decide.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Like in other forms of business, there are disadvantages too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>First,<\/strong> online shoppers face fraud and security concerns. It has also been widely criticized for being very insecure. Even with the latest security ware, hackers still manage to find a way to steal your data. Online shoppers should first familiarize themselves with online stores and how they protect their data before going on an online shopping spree.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The majority of online shoppers are unaware of various hacker attacks, phishing scams, and how they affect them. Not knowing how to keep yourself safe is the biggest disadvantage of online shopping. despite warnings from Snopes and other cyber <strong>\"police\"<\/strong> sites, the store may be a scam put up to gather people's credit card data and social security numbers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Second, online shopping puts you at a disadvantage. You can't see and feel first hand or try for size your purchase. You take the word of the description of the product which is usually cleverly crafted by online stores to make it sound appealing to people. There is no hands-on inspection, nor visual or physical impact for product suitability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Only when it arrives at your address, do you have the opportunity to check the purchases for what it is advertised as. The greatest rip is the inaccurate transactions which could result in no savings or additional expenses to the buyer. this is probably one of the biggest disadvantages of online shopping that turns many people off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Third, there is no means for you to check for full cost or hidden cost not until something unexpected happens. Online shops do not always list the other additional charges. All these hidden costs: handling fees, packaging costs, shipping or transit costs, replacement costs, return costs, fluctuating currency rates, can add up to quite an exorbitant sum. Are they borne wholly by the buyer ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There are many other online issues which are more technical in nature: usage of the computer, slow online connectivity, viruses and time zone differences. Other aspects would be personal to buyer: credit card payment, no cash transactions, immediate gratification, invalid warranties, no refunds and non-delivery of purchases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In summary, the main advantages of shopping online are convenience and cost savings, while the main disadvantages are security risks and reduced hands-on purchase gratification.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In conclusion, to benefit truly from online shopping, one has to be an intelligent experienced Internet user as well as a streetwise e-commerce online shopper.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148760","category_id":"85542","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Fighting crime<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong> <\/span>The environment is the surroundings and conditions one is brought up in.

I am going to use myself as the <strong>\"guinea pig\",<\/strong> the subject of the <strong>\"test\".&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The first evidence to my advantage is my home environment. I was not born into a rich family. You could say it is lower middle class but my parents manage to put food on the table, send us to school, pay the fees and occasionally treat us to \"cheap\" school outings [which actually are school sponsored] or an annual fast-food treat <strong>(yummy KFC).<\/strong> We are happy, united and able to laugh at our lack of nature comforts. Being able to accept our lot make us more determined to create opportunities. The environment is our teacher.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">However, when I look at some of my schoolmates who come from broken homes and are traumatized by their conditions, I realize the environment can have a negative effect on the child.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">My first conclusion is that the environment is important to the extent that the individual can cope with the lack or the excesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">My second evidence stems from my entry into the residential school system. I was plucked out from my <strong>'stable'<\/strong> home environment and thrown into the wilderness, a completely alien world to join <strong>13-year<\/strong> old girls and boys in a boarding school. Here, we have wardens to keep a vigilant eye on us and the school has rules and regulations which cover the whole gamut of our life for the days we are in school. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Occasionally during weekends, term breaks and holidays, we make the journey home but we come to regard the school as our first home. we learn discipline and time management.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I find that many take to the system like a duck to water but there are some who could not adapt to it. Some of them come from good homes, rich background with some from marginally deprived situations. The figures show that from within each group, there are a few dropouts or some who manage to swim and not drown. some from poor homes made fantastic improvements, some ho were high achievers did not succeed eventually. To some the environment spurs them to excel, to some the environment is a hindrance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The second conclusion is a mixture of the environment and heredity working in tandem so it really boils down to the individual to utilise all that he possesses to achieve his dreams.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">My last evidence is when I compare my abilities with those of my siblings. I am good at languages, science and mathematics but a fumbler when it comes to nuts and bolts and art. My younger brother could dismantle a bicycle and put I all together again in a jiffy. My demure quiet sister draws and colors <strong>\"dreams\".<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> My brother repairs my bicycle, my sister puts the finishing touches to my artistic goofs while I coach all in languages and Mathematics. I could not put our \"achievements\" to the environment but to the genes inherited from both parents.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The third conclusion leans towards heredity as the \"element\" responsible for the latent talent which only needs to be nurtured by the environment to flower and bloom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Looking back in retrospect, I believe that the environment fine tunes the inherited characteristics and makes room for latent talents to emerge. Added to these two elements is the inherent nature of the individual who nurtures his dreams into reality and realization.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The evidences and the conclusions point towards the fusion of the two: in some cases the environment determines the future and in other cases heredity dominates.

In conjunction with<strong> 'Road Safety Week,'<\/strong> I wish to give a talk on why road accidents occur and the ways to reduce them.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">News about road accidents and road accident fatalities always appear in printed and electronic media. In many cases, schoolchildren are the victims. It is for this reason that our school has decided to launch a 'Road Safety Week' campaign with the aim of raising awareness among the students on the need to be more responsible and cautions while on the road.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Why do road accidents occur ? According to police statistics, much of the carnage on the roads could have been avoided if road users had exercised patience and caution. Instead, drivers tend to speed, drive recklessly and race on the roads. Motorists are responsible for various other misdemeanors such as weaving in and out of traffic and not paying heed to road conditions. Sometimes road conditions such as the existence of potholes can cause accidents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Another major cause of accidents is the poor maintenance of vehicles. Vehicles with brakes and lights that do not function properly are potential hazards to other road users. Long-distance public transportation drivers can also cause accidents if they drive for long periods and are tired.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Summonses and penalties are ineffective in curbing road accidents. Stiffer penalties such as increasing fines and suspending driving licenses of offenders should be introduced. If a motorist causes an accident, the authorities should confiscate his driving license and suspend him from driving for a certain period of time. Stricter enforcement of traffic rules by the authorities will reduce the number of accidents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Only roadworthy vehicles should be allowed on the roads. Vehicles which break down often should be taken off the roads. There is also a clarion call from many quarters to increase the age limit for new drivers. This is one way of getting young motorists off the roads.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">If we do not want accidents to happen, then it is time we changed our driving and riding attitudes. Motorists must ensure that they are courteous on the road and that their vehicles are roadworthy. There should be more awareness campaigns aimed at inculcating good driving habits, especially among schoolchildren.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When road users ensure their vehicles are roadworthy, respect the law and think about their safety as well as that of others, then the number of fatalities can be reduced.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148762","category_id":"85544","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Social ills among teenagers<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong> <\/span>Absenteeism has long been a vexatious issue for school authorities. Students are absent from school every day without a bona fide excuse. The Counseling Club of our school carried out a survey to find out the reasons why the students are absent.<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Most of the students who are absent say that they find the lessons boring. In the light of this revelation, teachers should try and explore creative technologies and teaching ideas to increase student attendance. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Obtaining poor grades was another reason for frequent absenteeism. If the school becomes a place where students feel unsuccessful, then they want to avoid it. Therefore, special tutorial programs should be initiated to equip students with adequate academic skills.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Peer influence also has a significant bearing on student attendance. Students often miss class to be in the company of friends. Students who associate with delinquent peer groups are at risk. Student absenteeism may also be a red flag for a more serious problem such as anxiety, loneliness and stress. These students should be sent for counseling sessions. In addition, after school sports and other programs will enable students to make new friends and experience a positive environment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Results of the survey show that lack of parental supervision may also lead to absenteeism among students. As parental involvement relates closely to student attendance and academic progress, parents should be reminded of their responsibilities. School authorities should liaise with police and the local community to patrol neighborhoods where truant students are likely to spend school hours.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Occasional absenteeism among students can be excused. However, frequent absenteeism is a cause for concern as it has often been linked to serious problems such as violence, substance abuse, gang involvement and criminal activity such as burglary and vandalism. Left unaddressed, absenteeism can have significant negative effects on students, the school and on society. Therefore, it is critical to determine the reasons fro absenteeism and identify strategies to tackle the problem.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148763","category_id":"85545","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Bullying<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong><\/span> Statistics provided by the school's Disciplinary Board show that cases of bullying are on the rise.

This is an unhealthy trend and if left unchecked, it can become a problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Verbal bullying, which includes name-calling and insulting remarks, accounted for 45 per cent of bullying cases. This was followed by indirect bullying, which includes spreading nasty and malicious stories. It accounted for 35 per cent of all bullying cases. Physical bullying accounted for one-fifth of the cases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Bullying occurs for a number of reasons. Often, bullying behavior develops in response to the environment, whether it is at home, school or within a peer group. Bullies usually come from homes where physical punishment i used. In such a scenario, physical punishment is seen as a way to handle problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The child then resorts to aggressive behavior. Negative peer influence can further aggravate the problem. With the absence of a proper role model both at home and in school, children have no opportunity to learn behavior skills. As a result, bullies tend to derive satisfaction from inflicting injury or suffering to others without feeling empathy for their victims.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Close monitoring by parents and school authorities can curb bullying. Parents must monitor their children's activities. Those who are at the receiving end and bystanders must report all incidents of bullying. The school must enlist the help of parents when dealing with such cases. Schools must have clear rules against bullying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Repeat offenders must face the music.

Many medicines, foods, natural insecticides and oil producing trees are found in the rainforest.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The rainforest also holds endless possibilities for useful, undiscovered resources. These could include cures for disease and new food crops that will be wiped out before they are found because of the destruction of the rainforests.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The rainforest is also home to millions of species of animals, plants and insects as well. It is estimated that five out of six rainforest species have never been seen. This adds up to millions of organisms that have never before been encountered. This demonstrates that more species live in the rainforest than any other ecosystem on earth, and we are obliterating their on habitat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The rainforest is also a big producer of the world's oxygen supply. When we destroy the rainforest, we are destroying our own oxygen supply. Massive destruction of our precious rainforests is caused by logging, colonization due to overpopulation, and cattle ranching.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The first major cause of mass destruction of the rainforest is logging. There can be as many as 200 different species of trees on one acre of land.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This high number of different species of trees means there is only a few commercially valuable trees per acre. Trees considered commercially valuable are mahogany and tropical cedar. These trees and used for panelling, and building boats an furniture.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Loggers must bulldoze roads through the forest to find enough of these valuable trees to make a profit. This consumes many other trees that are in the way of the road. The trees in the rainforest are connected a the top with vines, so when one commercially valuable tree gets cut down, on average <strong>17<\/strong> other non-commercially valuable trees fall down with t. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Because of these practices, the logging industry can eradicate <strong>30<\/strong> percent of a rainforest where only a few commercially valuable trees were cut down. At this rat, they will be able to clear out whole rainforest sin a few years. After the loges themselves destroy so much rainforest, the roads they leave behind induce the next phase of rainforest destruction: colonization.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Another major cause of mass rainforest destruction is colonization. Roads left behind by loggers make the rainforest accessible to farmers looking for a place to live and grow crops. Farm families clear and burn the remains of the forest to plant crops to keep and sell. These families clear more land than they need to show others that they own it and have \"developed\" it. These colonists are forced to move to the rainforest because there is no room anywhere else for them to live.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Most of the land is owned by large corporations, so families feel lucky if they are fortunate enough to have their own land in the rainforest. Population growth forces the people to move to the rainforest. Even if farm families can get their own plot of rainforest land, it is not long before they have to move again and clear out more rainforest. Rainforest land loses nutrients quickly after it has been cleared, and it soon becomes eroded and infertile<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">. Since crops won't grow after this happens, farm families willingly sell the bad land to commercial companies. These companies then use the acquired land to form large produce export plantations or cattle ranching: the most destructive form of land use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The final major cause of mass rainforest destruction is cattle ranching. Cattle ranching in the rainforest yields very low amounts of beef, but it is replacing farming that was more productive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Cattle ranching yields <strong>91<\/strong> pounds of beef per acre per year, where as corn yields 5,000 pounds per acre per year. This is a very inefficient use of the land, and is also bad for the economy. After five to ten years of mediocre beef yields; erosion, weeds and loss of fertility force the ranchers to look for more land. T<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">he ranchers keep moving farther into the rainforest and clearing more land in a big cycle. Also, raising cattle requires less labor, so there are fewer jobs. The people without jobs are just more people who wan to move to the rainforest. The land just keeps getting cleared and burned until there is no rainforest left.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The rainforest gives us so much, and has so many possibilities, yet we are clearing and burning it down. Animals, plants and insects are being eradicated at the rate of <strong>1,000<\/strong> species per year. If the rainforest keeps being destroyed at the current rate, it is 10,000 species will be wiped out per year. If we want to save the earth, we must start with the rainforests. They are the connection between man and nature, and if the human race wants to save the planet, the first step is saving the rainforest. The rainforests are the most valuable resources we have.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148765","category_id":"85547","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A narrow escape<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong> <\/span>There was a huge three-acre pond just a few kilometers from where we stayed. Since moving into our new home in the countryside, my brother, Jim and I used to often sneak out to the pond where we would meet another friend. Dad had warned us not to venture anywhere near the pond area, especially after a friend informed him that an alligator had been spotted there. We took no heed of his advice though. This was our favorite hideout and we were certainly not going to give it up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">On this particular afternoon, the three of us had just finished swimming. Jim and Syed were reluctantly making their way towards the spot where they had left their clothes. I stayed back and was bathing in the waist-deep water when I suddenly became aware of ripples forming in the surface of the water. I cocked my head and looked at the ripples. My eyes caught a motion in the water. A log, I thought. Then I saw it -- its snout and its two reptilian eyes. 'Jim ...\" I whimpered. Then I screamed with all my might.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Jim turned his head in my direction and immediately recognized the danger. 'Get out of the water, Jeff. Hurry ! It's just behind you.'&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I waded clumsily in the water. After a few stumbles and fumbles, I reached the edge of the pond. I looked over my shoulder. Moving swiftly towards me was an enormous alligator. I froze.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Then suddenly I felt a searing pain in my leg. Meanwhile, Jim and Syed screamed and started throwing stones at the alligator and managed to distract it. The alligator went for them now. As it opened its jaws, I could see its jagged teeth. I tried to move but a stabbing pain shot through me. I slumped onto the ground, sprawled in a pool of blood.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Meanwhile our screams were heard by two hunters who were in the vicinity. On seeing the alligator, one of them fired a shot in the air. It had the desired effect. The alligator stopped in his tracks, retreated a few steps and slithered hurriedly into the water. Then, I passed out.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">When I regained consciousness, I found myself in a totally unfamiliar environment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The smell of antiseptic told me that I was in the hospital.

The pupils burst into a loud cheer, thinking of the break they would have from dreary school lessons. <strong>\"Freedom!\"<\/strong> they shouted. The teachers heaved a soft sigh of relief. They would also be glad for the freedom that the holidays will bring.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Teachers have a very stressful job, keeping a classroom of children in the seats for a whole school day. Some of these children may be hyperactive, some may be badly behaved or uncontrollable. Their own parents may be unable to cope with just one of them, yet teachers have to deal with as many as forty children at a time. Furthermore, a teacher's job is tedious and monotonous. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">They have to prepare lessons day in and day out, standing in front of one class after another. The long holidays will give them a chance to relax and recharge their batteries. Furthermore, teachers can attend courses during the long holidays. These courses will give them more ideas, skills and inspiration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Long holidays also give a break to the children, who active by nature, are cooped up for hours in a stuffy classroom. Then, after school, they are faced with piles of homework. On top of that, some children have to attend extra tuition in subjects they are weak in, or extra lessons in piano, violin, or guitar, ballet, or martial arts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">With so many structured activities, some children have no time to choose their own leisure pursuits. They have no time to \"stand and stare\". They also lack the time to bond with their family members, and relatives. The long holidays would give them the opportunity to go on holidays with the family; perhaps they can even spend time with relatives who live far away. They can also take part in other enriching activities, such as educational trips to a foreign country, or attend youth camps, such as Outward Bound, which will help in character development.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Yet, we have to take a realistic view at the other side of the argument. How many families can afford to send their children on overseas field trips or courses like the Outward Bound? In fact, in many families, the parents will be out working all day, and the children will be left unsupervised. This may be dangerous for younger children. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As for older children, they may be drawn to undesirable and anti-social activities, like theft, gangsterism, gambling and drugs. Furthermore, for some children, school provides their only exposure to academic learning. Thus, the long period away from their studies may cause some children to regress badly in their academic skills.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">So, in conclusion, long holidays are beneficial for some people and not so good for others. The teachers, who need a break from a stressful and tedious routine, will definitely welcome the break. Long holidays will also give opportunities to children from privileged homes to take part in enriching out-of-school activities. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">However, long school holidays may be detrimental for children from less privileged homes. In my opinion, for the good of the general public, schools should not have very long holidays. Or, if long holidays are to remain a part of the school year, certain activities or services should be provided for less privileged children to keep them occupied in a safe and useful way.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148767","category_id":"85550","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"Examinations\"&nbsp; good or bad ?<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong><\/span> <strong>\"Examinations\"<\/strong> - This is a word that causes sleepless nights, a word can change a cheerful person into a nervous wreck. So, what are examinations, and how can they be any good?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">An examination can be defined as a detailed inspection or analysis of an object or person. For example, an engineer will examine a structure, like a bridge, to see if it is safe. A doctor may conduct a medical examination to gauge whether a patient is healthy. In the school context, it is the students who take the examinations. These are usually a series of comprehensive tests held at the end of each term, year or, in the case of public examinations, after a few years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">One of the main purposes of school examinations is to improve the quality of education. From the results of the examinations, the teachers and planners of the curriculum will be able to gauge the extent to which the students have acquired the knowledge and skills of the course material. This would, first of all, provide an evaluation of their teaching methods, so they can improve them, if necessary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Examinations are also used as a yardstick for measuring the capability of the candidate, for further education or employment. For example, examination results are the main criteria when selecting students for entrance into universities. It is assumed that the examination results would indicate whether or not the student will be able to handle the course. In the case of employment, it is felt that the examination results will indicate whether or not the job seeker has the skills or intelligence to handle the job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">However, does the school examination system provide an accurate yardstick of the candidate's ability? Albert Einstein, at the age of <strong>16,<\/strong> took the entrance exam to the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, but failed and so was rejected by this elite school. Yet, Einstein went on to develop the theory of relativity and quantum theory, winning the Nobel Prize in Physics at the age of <strong>42.<\/strong> Other examples of famous achievers who failed in school examinations would include Winston Churchill, Thomas Edison and Bill Gates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">One may also question whether the present examination system results in better teaching in schools. In fact, some teachers are so pressured to produce good examination results that they are forced to practise poor teaching methods. They may race through the syllabus, ignoring the fact that the weaker students have not grasped some of the concepts. Some other teachers may concentrate on popular examination topics, ignoring the topics which are rarely tested in the examinations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Pressure to succeed in examinations may also be detrimental to the students. They may be so filled with anxiety and stress that they do not enjoy their school years. They may be studying only to get good examination results, rather than a rounded education. Some of the weaker students, who cannot seem to achieve good examination results, may lose interest in their studies. In extreme cases, students may be so frustrated or disappointed in their results that they may consider ending their lives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In conclusion, I realise that examinations are necessary and useful in many areas of our lives. However, within the school system, they should be given less emphasis or conducted in a different way. Furthermore, educationists, employers and students themselves should be reminded that examination results may not provide the best assessment of an individual's talents and capabilities.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148768","category_id":"85551","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"Health is wealth\" To what extent would you agree?<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong><\/span> The saying \"health is wealth\" is very apt as good health comes from a good physique that enables one to enjoy the pleasures and manage challenges of life. health here comprises the mental and the physical.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Thus I agree that good health is actually wealth as it allows one lead an existence without being hampered by disabling circumstances such as disability (both mental and physical), medical conditions such as diabetes, cancer and other potentially fatal diseases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> A disabled person faces a lot of challenges n life including having to depend on another for basic needs and perform simple tasks.

Thus, it would be foolish to think that money causes distress, and is the root cause of immorality and evil behavior. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">On the contrary, most of us earn an income through legal means which allows us to maintain a good standard of living. it enable us to travel for holidays and have access to good food, medical facilities, and a lifestyle that grants us much happiness and satiety. Many parents admit that they slog at work so that thy could provided comfort and stability to their offspring. Money especially comes in handy when a family member is stricken with a disease and cash is needed for treatment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Unhappiness results when we are denied the above. Many families struggle to make ends meet and the lack of money almost inevitably sows seeds of unhappiness. They are exposed to continuous bickering, quarrels and ultimately, misery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There are of course those, due to greed for more material wealth, resort to illegal means to become rich quickly. They commit robberies, murders and cheat to get ahead in lives. However, this does not grant them the happiness or the peace of mind. In the case of robbers and murders, the constant threat by the law enforcement authorities closing in on them, creates jitters and a life full of uncertainties and fear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Hence, money would always be looked at as the most or at least one of the most important keys to happiness. it has become a part of what defines us as human beings as it allows us to live a life of dignity, happiness and contentment.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148770","category_id":"85553","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Do you agree the widespread influence of western culture among students corrupt them morally ?<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong><\/span> It is very hard for Easterners to resist Westernization. The influence of western ideas and culture is widespread namely in dressing, mannerisms, food, books, entertainment and even education. However, western culture can also corrupt a person morally especially young people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There are many aspects of the western culture that are deemed not suitable for Asians namely its sense of fashion, moral values regarding pre-marital sex, pornography and wild entertainment. The young mind is easily influenced and corrupted. When one enters shopping complexes, restaurants and other public places, the first thing that catches one's attention is the way the young dress. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Many follow the fashion nuances of the west with little regard to Asian values and perspectives related to modesty. Many young teenagers can be seen clad in low cut tops, low waist jeans and in short very revealing outfits. They mimic western style of clothing as well free intermingling of sexes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">This situation has led to many undesirable consequences. Chief among them is the practice of free sex among students. The Asian values of saving oneself for marriage or until the right person comes along is discarded and considered archaic. Since many teenagers lack awareness on safe sex, they expose themselves to unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases such as <strong>AIDS,<\/strong> gonorrhoea, syphilis and other life-threatening disease. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>WE<\/strong> read newspaper reports almost on a daily basis on how unborn babies are being dumped in toilets, houses of worship, hospitals and other public places. There are yet many students who upon finding themselves pregnant resort to abortion. The later can be fatal if not done by professional gynaecologists. Many charity organizations report of teenagers coming for advice when they find themselves jilted by their boyfriends. There are also many reports on teenagers contracting <strong>STDs<\/strong> and other dangerous diseases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Another strong influence of westernization is in the arena of entertainment. Teenagers find it exciting and fulfilling when they visit video arcades, discotheques, nightclubs and other places of entertainment. Thus, they expose themselves tot he morally deficient elements at this kind of places. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Apart from picking up bad habits such as smoking, drinking alcohol and other behaviors unsuitable for people of such a young age, these teens also expose themselves to abuse and exploitation. Many young people have admitted to being sexually abused this way by friends or strangers who spike their drinks with drugs only to awake next morning in the bed of strangers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Thus, though not all elements of westernization corrupt young people morally, the latter seem more susceptible and even naive with regards to western influence in the arena of entertainment, fashion and behavior. Many teenagers demand unfettered freedom without realizing the consequences o their behavior which brings harm to them. In their desire to be westernized, they accept those elements which provides pleasure but places them at great risks.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148771","category_id":"85554","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">If you are the school discipline teacher, how would you tackle the problem of gangsterism among students ?<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong> <\/span>Indiscipline among students is one of the major problems faced by schools today. Gangsterism in particular has become a menace due to its violent nature. Gangsterism involves bullying, extortion and even physical assault. The victims are mainly fellow students and there have been a few cases in the Philippines where the act of bullying and assault had been fatal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">If I am the discipline teacher, I would first undertake to study the extent of the problem in my school as well as the reasons why students would get involved in gangsterism. I would then haul the bullies and suspected gangsters in the school to determine further the reasons behind their individual behavior.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Statistics and studies on gangsterism indicate most student gangsters hail from poor backgrounds or broken families whereby they lack attention and love from the family members propelling them to behave in such a manner. Poor students become gangsters as a means to gain extra cash by extorting money from other students. Those who are a product of broken families normally indulge in these kind activities to seek attention and as a outlet for their frustration and unhappiness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Thus, by engaging in a discussion with these gangster students from my school, I would be able to find out which category they belong to. I would then proceed to advise them on the dangers of their behavior which could land them in jail or in correctional institute for juvenile delinquents. If this method does not work, I would then engage the assistance of inspectors from the local police station to give regular talks at our school on why gangsterism is a crime and the penalties faced by the perpetrators.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A school-wide campaign would follow suit on how students and teachers can tackle the problems of gangsterism. the campaign would involve talks by former gangsters and reformed criminals who resorted to bullying and violence to achieve their goals and how that in turn has affected their lives and their families. Students would then be required to take a pledge not to resort to such behavior even if they face severe pressures from other students or as an easy way to make money from others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Instead of caning or punishing gangsters, I would counsel them and use the soft-handed approach. These facing financial troubles who resort to extortion as a solution would be given assistance pending their promise not to repeat such behavior. These who engage in gangsterism to seek attention would be sent for professional counseling. Students facing constant pressure to become part of gangs, would be exposed tot he dangers of such behavior and encouraged to report, without fearing for their lives, to the school authorities. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I would collaborate with the other teachers to expose students to fun-filled activities and outdoor learning experience to make school a more exciting place. This would prevent bored students from contemplating joining a gangster group to seek excitement and acceptance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Thus, I hope with all these measures in place, the problem of gangsterism would be dealt with effectively and efficiently.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148772","category_id":"85555","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">How can schools play a role in producing well-rounded individuals ?<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong>★★★ <\/strong><\/span>Schools play an important role in imparting knowledge and producing individuals with high moral and ethical values who contribute to our country's development.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">However, there have been accusations that Asian schools are not churning out well-rounded individuals. The main culprit they say is the education system which is heavily exam oriented and although students excel academically, they are not good in sports or extra curricular activities. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">even straight As students are considered only paper smart lacking common knowledge or even skills-based knowledge. Thus, schools play a vital role in ensuring its products are not only academically well qualified but also confident, intelligent and have multiple skills.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The most important step schools should take with the cooperation of the Education Ministry is to place less emphasis on scholarly achievements and examination grads. Currently, due to heavy stress on examination results, many, if not all, student study to excel academically rather than have a balanced approach to studies. they study had and attend tuition classes so that they are able to get straight As in all the subjects. This leaves them little time to indulge in extra-curricular activities or sports. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Thus, a markedly different way of grading and assessing students should be adopted like in the West. In order to produce well rounded individuals, grades should be given for assignments, extra curricular activities as well as involvement in sports. Ideally, only <strong>50%<\/strong> of marks should be allocated for examination and the rest for participation in non-academic activities. This would produce students with a innovative, intelligent and creative personality as progression in school would not be based solely on examinations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In addition, a system should be introduced to make it compulsory for students to volunteer with community-based organizations such as orphanages, centers for the disabled and other social non-governmental organizations. Assignments related to involvement in these organizations can form part of the examination system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Thus, students will be compelled to participate in various kinds of extra curricular and sports activities, under the guidance of their teachers of course. That would ultimately enable them to acquire people's skills such as communication and writing skills through the ability to interact with others and engage in stimulating discussions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Study environment can be made less mundane and monotonous by introducing outdoor learning experience. More emphasis on outdoor learning activities rather than those confined to classroom activities should be made part of the regular teaching method. Students thus, will acquire interest in their studies and would be able to expand their general knowledge Schools would stop churning out \"book worms\" and diffident students. Rather, this novel approach would produce students who are smart, intelligent, bold and inquisitive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In all, the task of producing well rounded students and hence, individuals lay heavily on the shoulders of the education ministry and teachers.

A healthy diet alone however is inadequate to ensure a healthy body as physical activity helps to keep one in shape and free of sickness and disease.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">According to the World Health Organization, only one in ten people exercise regularly and a majority do not follow a healthy diet. The main culprit is our penchant for junk food as can be seen from the popularity of fast food chains and other western eateries. even local foods such as fried noodles, friend rice and snacks and savories are laden with fat and calories.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Thus, consuming this type of food on a daily basis can contribute to weight gain. Overweight and obese people suffer from many health complications such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and even cancer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Hence, the emphasis on healthy lifestyle should start at a young age. Parents must urge their children to eat more vegetables, fruits, juices, wholemeal and wholegrain foods. Many parents, due to time constraint, usually find the easy way out by cooking two-minute noodles or heading towards the nearest fast food joint for quick meal. They do not realize however that sets the stage for an unhealthy lfestyle for their children who quickly become addicted to such foods. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Thus, parents can counter this problem by cooking or preparing meals that do not take up time such as cheese sandwiches, soup, stir friend vegetables or buy pre-packed meals from supermarkets which can be warmed up in the microwave oven.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Dining out usually involves eating heavily and unhealthily. Most of us are prone to ordering deep fried food and oily dishes as opposed to steamed or baked food. Thus, though eating out is unavoidable, parents of children and adults as a hole should order fresh food and foods that are nutritious and not laden with oil, fat or sugar. Once a pattern of healthy eating is established, it would be easier to carry through such a lifestyle and for the children to follow suit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">School canteens must be urged to sell only highly nutritious food and drinks. Vending machines that sell soft drinks and drinks that are spiked with sugar should be banned. Hence, school going children would be exposed to healthy eating form young.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Daily exercise is vital. In fact, schools should implement Physical education on a daily basis rather than twice weekly. Only the minority are actively involved in sports. Most students are sedentary and prefer to concentrate on their studies as they consider indulging in physical activities a waste of time. By enforcing regular exercise daily, these students would be exposed to the importance and benefits of exercise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Many parents and adults do not allocate time for physical activity. A large number of them work long hours and return home late thereby depriving themselves of the benefits of exercise. Parents must lead an exemplary life which can benefit their children by increasing awareness on the health benefits of exercising regularly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Bringing their children for walks in the morning or evening is a good start to achieve this goal. They should become members of clubs which have swimming pools and gym facilities. During the weekend, the family can strengthen their bond by adjourning to clubs for exercise and a healthy meal after that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In short, leading a healthy lifestyle is a conscious decision.

Many countries have a high death and injury rate on the roads; train, ferry and ocean-going ship disasters are regular enough to be commonplace, taking a global view. yet air disasters are usually fatal to all or most concerned and are therefore more widely reported.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Consequently there is international pressure to make air travel as safe as possible, and rightly so. Yet no form of travel can be made totally safe. The causes of disaster, whether natural or man-made, can never be completely eliminated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Looking first at natural causes, at least three can be identified. Bad weather is one. This includes storm, icing and air-pockets in the case of light aircraft; less so in the case of large jets with sophisticated instrumentation. One cause in the case of jets can be large flocks of birds or swarms of insects being sucked into the jet nacelles and thereby stopping the engines.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> This may happen at low altitudes. Little can be done to prevent this. A third is the alleged danger in what is known as the \"Bermuda triangle\" in which both ships and aircraft have been lost without trace. In the case of aircraft the reason is though to be loss of horizon due to electrical disturbance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Most dangers to aircraft however are man-made. The first and obvious danger is collision. In the busiest airports, especially in the tourist season, aircraft may take off as often as every twenty seconds. Much strain is imposed on aircraft dispatchers and traffic control generally. Clearance for dispatch is by radar and computer. Personal fatigue or mechanical failure in a radar center can be very dangerous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Aircraft often have to circle before being given landing permission, and collision or perhaps a near miss can result from mistakes in assigning heights. Most, though not all countries have strict regulations governing air traffic control. Any strike by operatives will cause grounding -- bad enough, but preferable to taking risks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Another cause of trouble may be the age of the aircraft. Metal fatigue eventually sets in; cracks appear, bits of the aircraft may fall off, even whole engines, or the passenger cabin may lose compression. This means almost certain death to all passengers and crew, and there have been cases where an aircraft has been lost because one of the doors was not properly secured. The important of safety checks before take-off is obvious. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">So also is the importance of regular and completely efficient servicing. Operatives' licenses can be withdrawn if government inspectors find inefficiency in this area. Most modern aircraft can shut down engines which catch fire, deal automatically with the fire, and proceed on three, or even two engines.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Cabin fires are equally dangerous. They may occur for any reason, but in many cases they result from a crash landing causing the fuel to ignite. two things are important here. First, cabin exit must be unimpeded. Some modern aircraft have built-in chutes for swift escape. Much of course depends on cabin staff and their ability to prevent panic. Second, the seat upholstery must be non-flam. Many people have died from the noxious smoke emanating from flammable upholstery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There is argument today about emergency drills. Normally a steward will explain life-jackets for use should there be a sea landing, and just mention oxygen masks which are lowered to each seat. Should all these by physically tried out by all passengers prior to take-off ? Such drills are boring and time consuming, but the time may come when they are mandatory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Some disasters are caused by pilot error. Recently a Shackleton in fog crashed into a hillside in Britain, killing twenty-five young men. the plane has a good safety record. Again recently the pilot of a plane with a faulty engine shut down the good engine due to the failure of his instrumentation. the plane crashed, killing most occupants, and virtually destroying a small village. Sometimes instrumentation can be affected by electronic interference due to unauthorized equipment carried in the hold or hand luggage. This hazard can be eliminated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Not much can be done about terrorism except through airfield security and electronic vetting of all passengers and luggage. Unhappily not all airports are really efficient in this regard. Efficiency would arrest the terrorist and the hijacker on the airport.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Finally, attempts by carriers to economize on pilot coverage and seating space must be prevented by law. The two essentials are fresh and fully-trained pilots, and reasonable space for movement in emergency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The answer to the question is no.

Even in housing estates, one encounters traffic congestion or slowdown and thus, a trip to the local store located just minutes from the house can take up to half an hour due to this. according to the police, congestion also leads to other problems such as road rage and road bullies in addition to fatal accidents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There are may ways we can help ease traffic congestions in our country. The main reason contributing to our roads being clogged up is the increasing number of vehicles, especially private ones, on the road. Most families nowadays have at least two cars. Thus, there has to be ongoing campaigns on the benefits of carpooling. Parents can make an effort to drive their children to work rather than helping him or her to purchase a car. Those with school going children should use school buses rather than sending them on their own. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There is always congestion near schools as most parents prefer to send their children for reasons of safety or convenience. Thus, a regulation must be introduced that bans parents sending their children in private vehicles. They should be instead encouraged to use school buses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The recent hike in petrol prices should be welcomed rather than criticized. Most people are able to afford cars not only because they are cheaper compared to say Thailand but also because petrol prices are relatively low. The increase in petrol prices by 30 cents a liter however, appears to have little impact in reducing traffic in major cities. Perhaps, the government should increase further the price of petrol to discourage people from spending idle time on the roads.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Another way to help our country overcome traffic problems is to increase the price of vehicles. The recent announcement of a drop in price of cars would only aggravate the traffic situation in our country. The government should take a cue from our neighbor country and introduce a steep levy on ownership of cars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> It should at the same time make public transportation more efficient, effective and affordable. In our neighbor country, cars are very expensive because of the levy imposed on them but the traffic situation is much more manageable. The latter is mainly due to the fact there are less cars and most people use the MRT, buses and cabs which are highly efficient.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It can be a nightmare to be on the road during weekends.

The physician, when he did not refer to the ancients, was still looking to chance experience for his knowledge; while 'Asiatic cholera' stalked the land.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">then it was that experience which began to be supplemented by experiment. Vesalius introduces dissection; Harvey discovered the circulation of the blood; Jenner banished the terrors of small-pox; Pasteur, experimental-chemist, turning to the study of micro-organisms, laid the foundation of Modern Medicine. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Listen, applying the new knowledge to his work with the scalpel, founded modern aseptic surgery -- all in three hundred years and simply because men began to observe closely and with open minds, while they caused things to happen, instead of observing casually, with closed minds and when things chanced to happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">What of the method by which men are thus creating or helping Nature to create a better physical environment for us all ? If the desire is for something intrinsically new, whether an alloy steel, a synthetic dyestuff, a radio tube, or a spineless cactus, it must be obtained, if at all, in Nature's prescribed way. it must be created, and nobody who is in a hurry to get something, has ever been very successful in learning what way Nature prescribes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> On the other hand, certain intellectually honest, enthusiastically persevering individuals, endowed with insatiable curiosity, keen power of observation, ingenuity, originality, patience, commonsense and the urge to take infinite pains, have been notably successful in inducing Nature to reveal her secret ways of working. Besides, to such, it is the best of all sports.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">So, when 'Curiosity' began to learn from Nature, he began to observe her closely and to record faithfully what he observed. as an experimenter, he is like any good general, man must have a well-thought-out plan of attack, but must also be an opportunist and change his plan to meet unexpected situations as they arise. He must be open-minded, must seek facts regardless of whether they may lead him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">If he is not open-minded, is not intellectually honest, he will be inclined to explain away an unexpected result; he may even refrain from recording it. In such a case, he is not playing the game, but he overlooks the fact that some of the greatest discoveries have come out of irregular results which were not rejected, but were further investigated. it was only a slight irregularity found in the orbit of Uranus that led Adams and Le Verrier, independently to discover Neptune.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> There was less tan one per cent of a residue of inert gas that persistently remained when Cavendish tried by electric sparking, to combine atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen. But he recorded and reported the fact and a hundred years later. Rayleigh, repeating the experiment found the residue to be a new gaseous element - Argon - which is used in gas-filled electric lamps. This was to all. Ramsay was thus led to discover in our atmosphere, a whole series of inert elementary gases, among them Neon, employed in the orange-red lights seen in the business streets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> it was from the detection of otherwise unexplained lines in the solar spectrum that Helium was discovered, though no one felt sure at the time, that it was peculiar to the sun. Later, Rayleigh discovered traces of it in the air. All these came about because painstaking experimenters observed closely and recorded faithfully what they saw. As Joseph Henry, contemporary of Faraday, put it, \"The seeds of great discoveries are constantly floating around us, but they only take root in minds well prepared to receive them\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Experiment conducted for the discovery of new facts and their relation to other facts is Scientific Research. Behind it all is the well-founded conviction that there is order in all natural phenomena.

Listen to his appraisal of the lot of the researcher, \"It is indeed a hard task when you believe you have found an important scientific fact and are feverishly anxious to publish it, to constrain yourself for days, weeks, years, sometimes to fight with yourself, to try to ruin your own experiments and only to proclaim your discovery after having exhausted all contrary hypotheses.

How wrong this is. Our way o life is completely dependent on science and its fruits surround us on all sides.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Renaissance first taught man to realize the value of scientific progress, but it was not until the 18th century that the Industrial Revolution in the West really showed the impact science could have on living through developments in land-tillage, commercial production, transportation, and the beginning of the supply of mass-produced consumer goods. Until about 1920, progress was steady but in the last 45 years, the process of applying of science to the needs of living has accelerated enormously. This has been proportionate to the rate of scientific discovery itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Today, there is available an enormous range of consumer goods from the simple frying-pan to the jet plane, from the alarm-clock to the computer. All these things serve to make life easier and more pleasant, yet in themselves do not constitute civilization -- merely its comfortable adjuncts. Progress in real living is achieved less through <strong>'things'<\/strong> than through education, the arts and the love of beauty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Science has nothing to say to us in these categories, merely providing aids and short-cuts. Without them, life would be no more than the struggle for survival; there would be no time or incentive to pursue higher things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Science gives us safe food, free from harmful bacteria, in clean containers or hygienic tins. It also teaches us to eat properly, indicating a diet balanced in protein and carbohydrate and containing vitamins. The results is freedom from disease and prolonged life. In pre-scientific days, food was monotonous and sometimes dangerous; today it is safe and varied. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It is varied because through improved sea, land and air transport food can now be freely imported and exported. Science has also improved clothing and made it more appropriate for climatic and working conditions. Man-made fibers and versatile spinning machines, today enable us to dress in clothes both comfortable and smart without being expensive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Home, school and office all bear witness to the progress and application of science. Nowadays, most homes possess electric lighting and cooking, but many also have washing machines, vacuum cleaners and kitchen appliances, all designed to increase comfort and cleanliness and reduce drudgery. Science produces the fan which cools the air, the machinery which makes the furniture and fabrics, and hundred and one other features for good living.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The books and papers are at school, and again everything from the piece of chalk to the closed-circuit television of instruction are the direct or indirect results of scientific progress. Learning is therefore easier. And clerical work is made far more speedy and efficient by the office typewriter, quite apart from the hundreds of different machines which relieve the manual worker of so much slow and monotonous toil in the factories.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the old days, the idea of travel or taking a holiday was the monopoly of the privileged few. Today, science has given us the steamer, the aircraft and the motor-car. New horizons are opened to us and the increase of wealth brought about by science has given us the means to enjoy the new leisure we have been given. But to enjoy life at all, we must be healthy and it is perhaps in the sphere of medicine that some of the greatest advances have been made. Today, because of the use of antibiotic and isotopes, many diseases are speedily cured and man has become, on the whole, a healthier being, set free from pain and illness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Science has been completely beneficial to ordinary living when properly applied.

Since the internet has mountains of information and data, many students download or copy the articles and submit them as part of their assignment.

Such books teach him the meaning of family life and virtues of honesty, peaceful living and integrity. But, the best of secular literature helps him to achieve the same object. The innocence of Ophelia, the nobility of Sydney carton cannot fail to impress and attract the reader.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Greek tragedy was intended to induce in the audience a 'Catharsis,' or purging of the emotions, primarily those of 'pity and terror'.

Great emotional pleasure may be derived from a good novel, as we enter fully into the life of the hero or heroine, an the best of writing, whether it takes the form of poetry, drama, or the novel has an undoubtedly maturing effect on our emotional nature.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">For most people, however, the 'refined' person is the 'educated' person, the person whose intellect has been developed through reading intelligent books. The clear, logical thinker owes much to his grounding in the school-room, and even more to the love of reading which this grounding has fostered. Reading becomes a stimulating function of adult life, and ceases to be a child's tool for passing an examination or getting a job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Cultured living requires that people should be 'well-informed,' and wide reading has the added advantage of imparting useful general knowledge. Thus, the well-read man or woman is more fitted to live in the community and travel, profitably, outside it. Such knowledge is obtained from a variety of sources ranging from the newspaper and magazine to the many available volumes of specialized non-fiction books.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">An added benefit of good reading is the development of a love of language for its own sake.

Most of those functions are now available in a child's pocket calculator.

It combines readily with word-processing, faxing, and the electronic creation of screen graphics, which can be modified either by keyboard control or by electronic pen. The analog computer rapidly solves differential equations for civil and mechanical engineering problems. The digital computer with it's card punching function permits access to data banks, and allows the processing of records and all the kinds of work connected with <strong>bills, orders, wages, VAT<\/strong> etc. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The computer today is integral in the world of business, commerce, design, word-processing and industry in general.

Today it is obviously possible for all workers down to lower-management level to work from home, and as computers continue to develop it is likely that firms will find it convenient to let an increasing number do so. Whether this is a desirable change is a moot point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Some visionaries anticipate the day when computers, in combination with robotry, will totally eliminate the need for work as we know it. This may theoretically become possible, though in any event computers could never quite eliminate the need for maintenance groups. To most of us, however, such a prospect would be appalling. Leisure only has value by reason or it's contrast with work, and the instinct to work is a built-in part of the human makeup. The past millenia have not adjusted our genes in this direction for nothing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A more likely scenario is that a much higher proportion of workers will eventually be able to operate from home. Of course, many people have always done so. The writer, the painter, the sculptor either work in the study or in an adjacent studio. Even the professional musician practices at home. Some of these are reclusive by nature, others not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The majority of people are naturally gregarious. To produce their best they need both the company of others, and the <strong>'atmosphere'<\/strong> of work. There is an instinct to go out to the job, and with all save workaholics. to be able to draw a clear line between work and leisure. The benefits of doing so are obvious. Easy association with others is confidence building. Ideas improve and extend as they are exchanged. You cannot get the 'feel' of a firm or institution at long range.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> If you have any responsibility at all you need to be in personal touch with managers and directors, not for ever using the telephone or the fax machine.

They can play games, educate themselves, prepare themselves for modern living. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">All this can be done with books and paper, but parents are pressurized into buying computers, never-the-less, the sop to their consciences being that they can use the computer for family accounts. Of course they can. Equally they could do their family accounts once a month on the back of an old envelope.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Advertising sells goods and services, otherwise it would not exist, and the development of advertising in the West dates back at least three centuries, coinciding roughly with the publication of early journals such as The London Gazette, Tatler and Spectator in England, the circulation of which was largely limited to London and one or two large provincial cities. So advertising began on a local basis, because wherever you create a demand you must be able to meet it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">So various factors combined to create national and international advertising; mass-production, based in the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, rail communication and transport, the development of printing, especially color printing, and the freighter for overseas markets. For as long as most people can remember advertising has been seen wherever the public go; on walls, shop fronts and hoardings, in railway stations and the underground, on streamers trailing behind light aircraft, from static balloons, on trains, buses and business vehicles, taxis and container lorries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> With the advent of color-television, the commercial break has assumed primary importance. Some commercial radio channels still carry advertising. Handbills, advertising local firms, flood through the letter-boxes. Junk mail, addressed to computerized lists of likely buyers, fills the waste paper baskets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">From this will be seen that over-kill is one drawback to the effectiveness of modern advertising. People get fed-up if they are over-pressurized, especially intelligent people. The hard sell becomes counter-productive. Yet the fact that it continues argues that this kind of advertising is financially justified.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Advertising is therefore big business, and the world's capitals, outside the Eastern bloc, offer scope to advertising firms with their highly specially areas of expertise. Such firms employ some of the best ideas people, graphic artists, promotional experts, and film producer and technicians.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The effectiveness of advertising depends on the assessment of the consumer's motivation in buying, and a direct or indirect appeal to that motivation; sometimes the creation of that motivation, by an appeal to a range of human instincts. Where there is poverty in a potential market the only effective appeal is based on cheapness, reliability and effectiveness in a product. In a mixed or affluent community the field is wide open. Most Western advertising works in a competitive market where the variety of brands is matches by the consumer's power of choice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The soft sell works best when appealing to the very rich, and usually price is not mentioned. A country house with a hundred acres of land is offered as a modest gentleman's residence, the Rolls Royce is merely described as 'the best car in the world. Everybody knows that a small group of products are the best in their fields, so advertising merely keeps them in the public eye. 'Apeing the celebrity' is another line of attack; if a famous heavy-weight uses a particular deodorant, or a great actress a particular shampoo, good sales result. Another successful line with a shampoo is that it works, implying that the others don't.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> In contrast sexy lingerie ads are self-defeating. they bore women and men don't usually buy lingerie. Yet sex can sell chocolates. If a stunt-man goes through the hoops to bring his beautiful girl-friend the brand of her choice he will take the easier way of buying them in the supermarket and she may begin to fantasize about the bringer. The appeal to snobbery still works. Because those bright, successful, affluent Jones next door certain brand names, the failed, boring economical neighbors must do likewise. Comic ads amuse some, repel others, but in either case people keep the brand name in mind, if only never to buy it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Most countries today have a statutory body which seeks to deep advertising up to a certain basic standards; ads must be morally decent, truthful and legal. However there are countless ways of disobeying the spirit if not the letter of the law. Subliminal advertising has rightly been banned. The advertising of foodstuffs has been improved by 'sell by' and statements of contents.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148782","category_id":"85565","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The advantages and disadvantages of industrial development<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong><\/span> Over the past three decades, there has been an explosion of industrial development in many Far Eastern countries, ranging from those with no work-force expertise to the far more sophisticated states such as Japan and Singapore. Most countries have .some natural resource to develop, be it oil, timber, rubber or minerals and gemstones. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The general process has been to exploit these resources by importing foreign expertise and equipment. Ideally, the results have led to dramatic increases in countries' <strong>GNP,<\/strong> favorable balances of trade, and the establishment of hard currencies which attract foreign investment. All these should lead to the building of hospitals and health centers, schools and colleges, sporting facilities and other amenities. Good wages should permit radical improvements in living standards. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Unfortunately, this only happens where a country enjoys a reasonably democratic political system. otherwise, in a one-party state, the temptation is to divert new money into armaments, unnecessary extravagances and sometimes the pockets of those in power.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Singapore and Japan are not typical of the Far East, since for decades they have been ahead of the rest in industrial development, although keen competition has reduced their lead in the past seven or eight years. Oil exploration in the Singapore region has dropped, and with it the demand for the re-export of oil-related machinery, drilling equipment and metal sheets and bars. Electronic components, diodes, photocells and integrated circuits; consumer goods such as <strong>radios, TVs, clothing, furniture and vegetable oils<\/strong> have also declined, due to competition from countries where much lower wage-levels are acceptable. However, Singapore will always benefit from its free trade zones. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There are six; five for seaborne cargo and one for airborne. With their time-limited but duty and document-free storage facilities, they will always remain an attractive proposition. So does INTRACO, an international and paid-up trading company which has many useful functions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The above relates to trade as much as to industry, but the results of both are much the same. On the industrial side, apart from the products listed in para <strong>2<\/strong>, mention must be made of the great diversity of industrial products in modern Singapore; industrial chemicals, printing and publishing, shipyard restructuring and upgrading, aircraft repair and overhaul capabilities, machine tools and related products, and office equipment. Less than 5% of the land area of Singapore is used for farming, the main products being pork, poultry, eggs, vegetables, fish and cut flowers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">So to summarize the advantages. Industrial proliferation generates jobs. Money can be spent on universities, colleges, schools and training centers. State housing, mostly blocks of flats, offers rented accommodation. Health, social and police services can be financed. Typical health hazards, such as the anopheles mosquito, can be eliminated, and both hygiene and family planning publicized. Above all, relatively late industrialization means that state-of-the-art factories can be built. There is no legacy of ancient factories to modernize or demolish.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Yet all is not sweetness and light. There is something to be said for a more leisurely pace of life. A sudden shift to urban dwelling and high tech employment can and does set up psychological problems, which lead to health problems. Moreover, there was something to be said for the semi jungle nature of Singapore, and it would be pleasant to have a few wild tigers present. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">However, the main disadvantage is that industrialization sets up living standard expectations which depend absolutely on a healthy overseas trade. At present there is a world trade recession. Also, surrounding countries are becoming far more competitive. Inflation and widespread unemployment are the chief dangers.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148783","category_id":"85566","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">What do you consider to be effective means of keeping law and order in today's society ?<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong><\/span> Obviously the practical means of doing so lies in the hands of the police force, para-military antiriot forces, and, in the last resort, the armed forces themselves. In democratic countries, these are firmly under the control of civilian governments, the members of which are freely elected.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Governments legislate and judiciaries administer the law. However the degree of control over the individual and the nature of the sanctions to be applied depend partly on the traditions of the country concerned and partly on the seriousness of the law and order problems which the country faces.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">What are today's problem? Political protest, leading to strikes, street demonstrations, physical violence, use of arms and weapons, mob violence and vandalism, looting, and in extreme cases, civil war. Football violence, such as has recently excluded England from matches in Europe. Crime against the person and against property <strong>e.g. murder, rape, theft, burglary and vandalism.<\/strong> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">These evils spread from country to country by imitation through international media publicity. Paradoxically, they also spread when law and order sanctions are either tightened or relaxed. This dilemma faces Mr Gorbachev precisely because of glasnost and perestroika, particularly insofar as political unrest spreads through the Soviets and Russia's satellite neighbors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">So the distinction between personal and political motivation behind lawlessness must be made. Where the motivation is personal, i.e. based in natural violence, social resentment due perhaps to deprivation, greed, sexual amorality, hatred or drug-induced mental states, then sanctions must be toughened as required. There are arguments for and against the death penalty, but there is little doubt that it provides an effective deterrent. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There are arguments against physical punishments, but they also deter. English law provides severer penalties for offences against property than against the person. In view of the muggings, street and public transport violence experienced today, this must be reversed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The modish, liberal explanation of the increase of such crime is that `society rejects the poor and underprivileged. Rebuild slum areas and offer more government handouts and crime would disappear'. This is nonsense. What is society but a collection of individuals? Every individual is endowed with personal choice. The individual must be made to choose the law and order path. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Religion and morality must be instilled into children in the home, in the school and in the workplace. Some form of compulsory national service of a non-military nature would benefit young adults of all racial origins and of both sexes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The more difficult question is that of offence against law and order when the motivation is truly political. Do citizens owe a duty to support and preserve the established order in return for the benefits they receive from it? If not, at what point does the freedom fighter become the terrorist? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">At what point in a democracy does the legitimate lobby become the violent, chanting, vociferous and sometimes blackmailing pressure group? The answers must of course depend on the political stance of the individual. Again however the distinction between political and personal motivation must be clearly made. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In Ireland religion and politics are used as a cover for common criminality. In South Africa the motivation behind violence is often tribal rivalry or the instinct to loot, pillage and murder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The justification for using the sanctions already mentioned in order to maintain law and order when offences are political lies in the quality of any country's government. Where there is democracy, where there is a multi-party system, where the legal system is fair, where human rights including that of free speech within the law are preserved, there lies the justification. When these things are denied then there can be a case for resistance, even revolution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Yet underlying the spread of common criminality is the flight from religion and morality and the weakening of the family system. Much youth delinquency could be pre-empted by discipline in the home, school and work-place, always provided the motivation behind such discipline is affection and the true well-being of the young person.<\/span><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148784","category_id":"85567","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">'Mathematics' is the most perfect language of all for Discuss<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong><\/span> Strictly speaking, a language is a verbalized means of communication, enabling the speaker to convey thought to another person. However, the more complex the thoughts or ideas, the harder or more cumbersome language becomes. To explain verbally why 'the square on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle equals the sum of the squares on the other two sides' would require a long and tedious paragraph or great math tutors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> And this is the simplest possible example; anything more complicated would be unmanageable. So in this way mathematical symbols which nowadays are universally accepted, compress information in a way that no ether 'language' possibly could, and this fact supports the topic statements.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">However, this <strong>'language'<\/strong> is only available to most people in it's simplest forms, i.e. arithmetic, algebra and geometry, and these are taught in schools because they have everyday usage. The shop assistant needs arithmetic, unless there is an automatic cash till, and technicians of all kinds need the other two; perhaps more, such as trigonometry, logarithms and the calculus, should he or she be dealing with quantities that vary in time and space. In this sense, of course, mathematics is a minority language, a language intelligible only to the specialists of all nations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The time may come when knowledge of higher mathematics is far more wide-spread, however. The 'new' mathematics is now being taught in many schools, sometimes alongside the traditional approach, and younger students find the new methods more intelligible. The principles of course have not changed; merely the setting out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">However, there are great developments available to younger students enabling them to see the subject as a whole rather than as a series of separate compartments, and this should engender more interest in those whose natural bent is in the direction of the arts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Mathematics has been described as 'the spearhead of natural philosophy', and this was certainly true up to about <strong>1800.<\/strong> The subject grew up independently in China, India, the Arab world and Europe. For example, many of the Alexandrian and Greek schools of geometricians, represented by Thales of Miletus, Pythagoras, Euclid, Archimedes etc advanced propositions which were already Pythagoras, Euclid, Archimedes etc advanced propositions which were already known elsewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The West derived it's numbers system from the Hindu-Arabic world, which reached Europe in about <strong>1000<\/strong> AD. The West learnt mathematics from the Arab world and, from the 15th century, great developments took place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Descartes revived algebraic geometry, Napier invented logarithms, Newton and Leibnitz the calculus. Lobachevsky developed non-Euclidian geometry, and was followed by Einstein, though the latter was more of a physicist than a mathematician. From Newton onwards, mechanics and astronomy began to use advanced mathematics and, later on, physics came in for the same treatment. Both <strong>'pure'<\/strong> and <strong>'applied'<\/strong> mathematics became the indispensable tools of progress. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Pure maths reaches conclusions by means of the deductive process, and may be independent of need. Applied maths consists of developments to meet the requirements of science and technology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">So mathematics has become a<strong> 'beautiful language'<\/strong> in several senses. Firstly, in it's ability to compress ideas, just as a great poet achieves desired effects by great verbal economy. Second, because it's tools, the symbols, are internationally accepted. Third, because it is entirely objective, and completely exact, allowing no room for prejudice or human emotion. Fourth, because it constantly provides the ground for new hypotheses. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">These in turn are checked by logic and observation. Often as with Pythagoras, mathematical conclusions can be checked by other means.

It is true that much suffering is caused by accident and natural disaster and is therefore almost unavoidable. A drunken car driver may kill or maim. Hurricanes and earthquakes leave a trail of death, injury and havoc. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Some steps may be taken to lessen the likelihood of this kind of suffering by imposing severe penalties for drunken driving, or living, if possible, outside hurricane and earthquake centers, but the innocent still suffer, and are likely to go on suffering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Unmerited suffering has always perplexed philosophers, who can rarely say more than that we live in an imperfect world. Religions supply explanations; God, or the gods, punish mankind for breaking the divine law, and to some extent this is true. Abuse of alcohol, tobacco, drugs and sex carries with it automatic retribution. Whether catastrophe is a direct form of retribution for sin, imposed by a divine being or beings is very doubtful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">What is quite evident is that we are required to live in a world which is dangerous, and whatever protection from either natural or man-made disaster we can find has to be made by ourselves. Some religions teach that there will be an after life in which all wrongs will be set right, and where the injustices of this life will be redressed. This enables the faithful to put up with whatever misfortune comes their way in the hope of better things to come. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Suffering has to be faced by everybody, sooner or later, and it is no use philosophizing about divine impartiality. \"God's rain falls on the just and the unjust\", says the Old Testament. Nearer the mark is this rather flippant rhyme;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">\"The rain it raineth every day&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Upon the just and unjust fella, But mostly in the just, because&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>The unjust hath the just's umbrella'.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The lessons of history are against the probability of abolishing suffering, yet that is the ideal, the objective towards which all civilized human beings should work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">If selfishness and hatred could be replaced by unselfishness and love, this would go a long way towards the alleviation of suffering. Ever since pre-history there have been wars, usually caused either by pure aggression of by greed for fertile and or natural resources. Since <strong>1945<\/strong> war has taken on a new and horrific dimension. Though nuclear bombs have been used only against Japan, there is a proliferation of nuclear weapons, and recently there have been terrible examples of the use of napalm, nerve gases, and chemical armaments. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There is no need to enlarge on the resultant suffering. And since all these armaments are universally available, and since the arms trade virtually knows no boundaries, any real progress must lie in the direction of multi-lateral disarmament and severe restriction on the arms trade. This can only be achieved by a move towards the \"one-world\" concept and a heightened respect for the dignity and basic rights of the individual.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The latter point raises the matter of political systems. Most civilized countries today are governed democratically rather than autocratically. The democratization of much of Eastern Europe is a real step forward. Gone are the secret police and the barbarous acts perpetrated against the individual by the previous regimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> However, political oppression and brutality to dissenters still exists in many parts of the world. It is to be hopes that the major powers will exert such pressure that autocracies will finally be overthrown. With that overthrow could come an end to torture and the physical and mental degradation which continues to scar the face of humanity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There are three final points. First, religious fanaticism, an age-old problem. Does God want \"Holy Wars\" and the self-sacrifice of teenagers on the battlefield? Does God approve of hostage-taking, of the bombing of town centers or aircraft? There is one theme common to all true religious belief; \"Do unto others as you would they do unto you\".<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Second, the poverty of the<strong> \"third world\".<\/strong> The wars waged by, and the cynicism shown by many third-world leaders should be brought to an end, if necessary by force. International and voluntary aid is often diverted to the purchase of arms and the feeding of troops.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Finally, the frailty of the human body itself. It is true that God allows physical suffering but has given man the intellect t alleviate or prevent it, then medical research must not be hampered. Science is on the way to finding the cause, and therefore the elimination of cancer and other inherited diseases. Genetic in vitro probes can also prevent the birth of handicapped children.

It is a foster home complete with wardens and teachers who are surrogate fathers and mothers. The school is fitted with the best if not better facilities than day schools. The hostels resemble home facilities. The hostelites receive a better and advanced level of education.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Second,<\/strong> it is expected that a boarder's potential is exploited to the maximum where he has the upper hand over his peers in day schools. Not only does he develop physically, psychologically and emotionally, he is also groomed to face life's challenges. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">He builds up a strong mental framework. He learns lessons of self-reliance and care for others. A residential school is the mini-university of life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Third,<\/strong> adapting to a new environment would ease a boarder to enter into other worlds as he grows. He becomes self-reliant and tackles problems independently. He cultivates self-respect within himself. He is confident as he learns to believe in himself. He grows in maturity as he takes appropriate decisions to recognize his aptitude and talents.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I have enumerated the factors in favor of residential schools. Despite the scales being heavier, I still wish to opt for a day school. These are the minus factors of residential schools.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>First,<\/strong> day schools may have a dense population per class. The facilities may not be the best but students make do with whatever they have and learn to do without what they do not have. the teachers may not be the best but one thing I do know, they are genuinely concerned for their students and give of their best. they are also our surrogate fathers and mothers. Their goal is to make us worthy of ourselves and for us to peak academically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Second,<\/strong> the challenging school environment under the tutelage of both teachers and parents allow us room to metamorphose into dynamic personalities. Day schools set high goals too so that students mature into self-confident, independent and responsible adults.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> I have the trust and the faith in my teachers that they would not abandon us but allow us to bend with the willow, as they had executed for the past students who are living testimonies of their guidance.

I am bonded to serve the government in a position anywhere where my training is needed. Government service is steady and safe but as with any civil service, there are procedures and regulations, seniority and promotion, General Orders and ethics: they are good for morale and discipline. However, the situation calls for red tape and work can be agonisingly slow.

After that, I would look at the disadvantages of being promoted to the next level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>In the first place,<\/strong> retention gives him the opportunity of relearning all that he had learnt previously. Furthermore, his previous learning would be further reinforced with relearning and revision. Compared to other learners of the same age, he needs extra time to learn and to understand. What is more important is that he becomes more confident. Besides, he knows all the stuff; therefore, he just needs to apply them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Secondly,<\/strong> he has to improve on his study skills and techniques. I believe that an additional year at the same level would polish his learning abilities. In addition, not being in an examination class, there is less pressure. He has more time to study at his own pace. Be doing so, it would enable him to perform without any pressure. Once he does just as well as his form mates, his zeal for learning would return. His achievements would raise his own self-esteem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Thirdly,<\/strong> different children develop physically and mentally at different rates. No two persons are alike. Einstein and Winston Churchill were not brilliant students in school. One became a famous scientist and the other a much-admired politician. Some people are late developers and some are early bloomers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">I have presented the three advantages of retention. Now, I shall give my views on automatic promotion.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The first disadvantage is that another level means new materials to be learnt. He has not yet truly comprehended the old materials that he learnt the previous year. The crux of the matter is that whatever is learnt in one year is the basis for the next year's work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> A weak foundation can bring about a tumble. Not only has he to study hard, but he can also find it nerve racking. It cannot be doubted that when an average student finds it difficult to understand, what more a struggling student ?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>The second disadvantage is,<\/strong> he has no time to brush up on his previous year's work for he has loads in the current year to understand and to learn. Undeniably, he may find it such an uphill battle that he loses courage and just surrenders. That cannot be allowed to happen. A student must see light at the end of the tunnel for him to continue to persevere in spite of great odds against him. Giving him a second chance of \"recouping\" his losses would set him on the road to success.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Thirdly,<\/strong> no two persons learn, understand, retain and assimilate then regurgitate at the same constant. There are too many variables and preconditions and hypotheses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Having presented both views: the advantages and drawbacks, I have to let him decide for himself.

There is no shame in accepting his shortcomings and bravely acting on them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">There is no wrong or right decision.

I would have to take into consideration several relevant factors: the objectives of the fund raising, the target amount to b raised, the initiators or the organizers, the nature of the fundraising project and the beneficiary or beneficiaries among others.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Before deciding on whose shoulders the task should fall on, it is fundamentally sensible to consider both aspects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the first instance, if the organizers undertake the fundraising on its own with volunteers, then all the monies collected minus permitted expenses go directly into the coffers of the organization.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">However, if professional fundraisers are the \"workers\", then they need to be paid. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Some organizations have rules concerning the minimum and maximum allotment going to professionals and in essence there should be no hanky panky in such projects. Unfortunately, some professional fundraisers are rather unprofessional in their dealings with genuine charitable fundraising.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the second instance, volunteers are truly enthusiastic and go all out to raise funds. There is a natural passion for the worthy cause. The handicap is that most of them may be greenhorns at this game or unschooled in the art of fundraising. Such a situation can be demoralizing.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">However, the professionals are just doing a job and that is as far as it goes. They have an added advantage in that they are trained personnel at fundraising and have more than a dozen tricks up their sleeve, quite unlike the motley crew of volunteers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the third instance, members of the organization could use their connections to solicit funds in a legal way and could request for periodical contributions or donations<strong> (monthly or annually)<\/strong> from giant corporations. Such corporations are known for their company policy of returning in kind or cash to Mother Earth and the community. At the same time, genuine fundraisers have to be aware of bogus fundraisers who get on the bandwagon and fleece generous donors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">On the other hand, some mega companies already have their pet projects and are no longer interested or have no other allocations in sponsoring any new charities. It is like talking to a stone wall. In addition, there is the danger of volunteers and professionals overlapping in collecting funds, all for the same purpose and for the same company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Having looked at both sides of the coin, I am more in favor of volunteer fundraisers. My primary reason is all the funds collected would become the \"property\" of the organization. The objective of the project is to raise as much money as possible and if a percentage goes as fees to the professional, then the quantum coming to the fund is reduced. My second reason is when volunteer fundraisers continue to raise funds, they would gain experience and even be better than the professionals one day.&nbsp;<\/span><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">So welcome to the world of fundraising, volunteer fundraisers.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148791","category_id":"85574","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Civil service or government employment<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong><\/span> <strong>Employment in the civil service refers to employment in the government sector as opposed to the private sector.<\/strong><\/span><br \/><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">What attracts the job seeker to the government sector ad not to the private sector ?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Firstly, there is the job security factor. Once an applicant is successful in being offered employment, he is well assured of being employed as long as he does not create anarchy or break too many General Orders. Even if he is guilty of a few indiscretions, he will most probably get away with it without any serious repercussions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">At the most, he will be given verbal then written warnings, even counseling. Sometimes he is downgraded and his job is not at stake. The starting pay may be low and promotions are few and far in between, but with Cuepacs, the umbrella body for civil servants unions, speaking up for them, there are provisions for bonuses and pay revision. In a nutshell, the job is his for life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Unlike the private sector, it is not so stable. The work ethics are more stringent and employees have been known to be dismissed for the flimsiest reasons. Then, there are the uncertainties when companies downsize followed by retrenchment or businesses go bust. The plus factor for the private sector is the higher starting pay, higher bonuses, quicker promotions and better increments based on performance. The work is more challenging and stimulating. The minus factor for private sector employees is the growing trend to employ contract not permanent staff.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Secondly,<\/strong> there is the pension. To make it even more attractive, the employee has the option of choosing either to stay a contributor to the EPF (after the probation period) or go for the pension scheme. If he opts for the pension scheme, he has an income for life and if survived by a wife, it is hers too for life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Thirdly,<\/strong> there is the additional perk of almost free medical treatment for life for himself, his wife and his children who are minors.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Admittedly, there are some private companies that do offer medical subsidies but with certain medical panels only.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Next,<\/strong> comes the relaxed working environment. Almost all government departments are air-conditioned or quite conducive. Although there is the clock-in and clock-out routine, there is little urgency in the government departments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Similarly,<\/strong> the conducive working conditions do exist in the private sector. However, the relaxed working environment is not so apparent, in fact the private sector is like a pressure cooker for performance is linked to profits and contracts. Employees are under pressure all the time to perform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Finally,<\/strong> the most appealing factor about government service is that the employees are in a privileged position. The public go to them for help. They endorse, approve or reject applications and appeals, interpret existing laws and regulations: the power is in their hands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In the private sector, due to competition between similar brand product and service providers, the employees have to ensure that their clients are well treated and well served. After all, the consumer is always right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Having looked at the pros and cons, we can now understand why people are lining up to join the government service despite detracting facts like low pay and poor pension. Applicants for government jobs look to other factors to be a part of the government machinery. However, if complaints about the public sector are anything to go by, there has to be a change in the mindset of those joining the public service. As the Prime Minister says, \"We do not need Little Napoleans.\"<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In conclusion, it depends on the individual to decide where to serve: in the government or private sectors. If you are thinking of security, then go for government service. If you are thinking of challenges, opt for the private sector. An employee in whichever sector who does an honest day's job and who sometimes goes beyond the call of duty will receive his rewards in more ways than one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&gt;<\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148793","category_id":"85575","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Is it better for mothers to stay at home ?<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong><\/span> Governments all over the world are encouraging education and are trying to remove barriers to education. As more and more women are also getting an education there are greater employment opportunities for them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In spite of this, there is a greater need for women to stay home and be homemakers. Young children and growing families require the attention of mothers. If women are to spend eight hours each day at work, then the children, especially the very young ones, would have to be left at day care centers, nurseries, with maids, grandparents or relatives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It cannot be denied that mothers are the pillars of strength in any family. If they give up their role as homemakers and thrust it onto others, such as maids, then there may be some unpleasant consequences. In some cases, children have been abused and in other cases, they have been greatly influenced by the maids, who are usually foreigners.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> The children would not only have to learn the language of the maids, but would also be susceptible to the mannerisms, customs and practices that do not belong to their own cultural background.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As it is expensive to hire maids, in some cases children are left in the care of others who may exert a negative influence on the children's upbringing. It is therefore imperative that mothers should stay at home to care for their children, especially during the crucial period of their growth. Furthermore, mothers would be able to guide and supervise their children in their daily routines and therefore act as role models for their children. When mothers stay at home, they will be able to mould their children better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It is said that the generation of tomorrow depends on the mothers of today. Social ills and other socio-cultural problems, faced by both young children and teenagers, could be eradicated if mothers stay at home and not go to work.

Criminals who are put on the death row include those who are arrested for drug trafficking and those who commit murders.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In Asia, death by hanging is the most common method of capital punishment. Among the countries, lethal injections, electrocution and death by a firing squad are more common.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Should the death penalty be abolished ? The proponents for the death penalty feel that the punishment meted out to a criminal should reflect the seriousness of the crime. If this line of argument is followed, then a person who kills deserves to die. In other words, a person who takes another person's life, forfeits his won right to live.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Another argument is that the death penalty is an effective deterrent to crime. If murderers and drug dealers know that they will be punished by death, they will be less likely to commit the crimes.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The main purpose of capital punishment is to isolate criminals from society so that they will not have the opportunity to repeat their crimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Whatever the reasons are for defending the death penalty, I feel that it is an archaic form of punishment that has no place in a modern, civilized world.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It is true that crimes of a serious nature deserve severe punishment. But taking a person's life in return is equivalent to taking revenge or<strong> 'an eye for an eye'. <\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Two wrongs do not make a right. Hence, when we put criminals on death row, we are stooping to their level. Instead, if a serious crime is committed, the criminal should be sentenced to life imprisonment. By spending the rest of their lives in prison, these criminals would have time to reflect on their misdeeds and repent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">No matter how careful and fair the judicial system is, the possibility of perjured testimony and human error always remains too real a threat to be brushed aside. If a member of the jury makes a mistake, a person can be falsely accused of a crime. If the death penalty is meted out to a person who did not commit the crime, then the sentence cannot be revoked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">It is not true that the threat of capital punishment reduces the number of violent crimes because most crimes are committed on the spur of the moment or under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Many offenders, therefore, do not think about the consequences of their crimes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Preventing crimes from happening is the most effective way to deter crime. Increased surveillance or police patrols, an increase in the number of police officers and a strict control on the availability of weapons are more practical alternatives in the practice of crime prevention.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">For these reasons, capital punishment should be abolished.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"148796","category_id":"85577","descr":"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta charset = \"UTF-8\" >\n<style> \nh3{\ncolor:red;\n}\n<\/style> \n<\/head>\n<body>\n<h3 align=\"center\"><\/h3>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Waste management is our responsibility<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>★★★<\/strong><\/span> Hong Kongers generate about <strong>15,000<\/strong> tons of waste daily. If this mountain of waste is disposed of properly, then we have little to worry about. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Litter is strewn all over the country -- in car parks, empty lots, back lanes, drains, rivers -- practically everywhere. the sights are all so familiar, the stench is overpowering, yet we display our indifference. The crux of the problem is attitude.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In response to this, the government has begun a recycling campaign as a long-term measure to ensure the efficient management of waste. Recycling involves the separating of rubbish -- metal, glass, plastic and paper. the waste is then taken to collection centers which turn the waste materials into reusable products. Recycling is an efficient method of reducing waste without polluting the environment. It also cuts down the use of raw materials and energy required to produce new products.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Other waste disposal methods come with attendant risks to health and the environment. One of the most common methods of waste disposal is landfills where waste is dumped and left to decompose. While landfills are convenient and cheap, they release toxic gases. Landfill gas can kill vegetation. Methane, a greenhouse gas, is released when landfill waste decomposes and this also contributes to global warming. Besides, decaying waste also attracts pests such as rats and carrion-eating birds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Waste materials can be burned in incinerators. When waste in burned, carbon dioxide and other hazardous air pollutants are released into the atmosphere. Thus, although this method is a convenient and quick way of getting rid of waste, it has its disadvantages as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Now that we all realize the environmental degradation that ensues from the country's waste, let us be more responsible citizens. The more waste we generate, the more we have to dispose of and the more waste we dispose of, the more money we will have to pay.
