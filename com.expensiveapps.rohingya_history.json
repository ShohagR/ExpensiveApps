The Muslim population living in this region later became known as Rohingya.<\/p>\n<p>In the ninth or tenth century Arakan State was known as 'Rohan' or 'Rohhang', the origin of the word 'Rohingya' as a resident of that region. From when exactly this word is being used, its exact time is not known.<\/p>\n<p>In the seventh century, survivors from a ship drowning in the Bay of Bengal say they have survived in the mercy of the Rohingyas. The word 'Rohingya' comes from this mercy.<\/p>\n<p>But the Myanmar government does not recognize the existence of any word as 'Rohingya'. Rohingya Muslims in the western region of Burma, present day Burma, Muslim minority community About 20 lakh Rohingya in number, most of them<\/p>\n<p>Named after the Bangladesh-Myanmar border, the North Rakhine state has lived in three townships in the state of Arakan<\/p>\n<p>Rohingyas are non-state people Their residence in the Rakhine state of Myanmar. The original name of the Rakhain state is Arakan. Although the ancestors of Rohingyas have been there for hundreds of years, but Myanmar \/ Burma government never called the Rohingya community<\/p>\n<p>Not recognized as a citizen; In the near future, the Rohingya people live in different refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh and Thailand, including the Rakhine state as a non-person.<\/p>\n<p>Chandra Dynasty ruled the Arakan region in the eighth century AD. A ship of Arab merchants broke down on the banks of the Rambri island. Some Arabs visit the Arabian shores and seek help from the locals. King Mahat Ying Chandra helped them. Some Arabs<\/p>\n<p>Local women get married. Mahat Ying Chandra granted it to the Arabs for their settlement.<br \/><br \/>In the fourteenth century, Muslims in Arakan stabbed themselves. The then Buddhist King Narameikhla (who retraced his kingdom<\/p>\n<p>In the support of Gaur's Sultan Jalaluddin Shah, he took the Muslim Advisors and courtiers in his court. But after the south Buddhist Burmese occupied Arakan, Narameikhla was defeated.<\/p>\n<p>After the capture of Arakan, Buddhist Burmans drove out all the Rohingya Muslims. About 35 thousand Rohingya fled to Bengal (currently Chittagong area) under the British-Indian era.<\/p>\n<p>The advent of Portuguese pirates began in the Bay of Bengal in 1530. Rosong King Jokshak appointed Portuguese teachers as a guide to the Mughals. Slowly he is a strong man with Arakan Maghs.<\/p>\n<p>Build the fleet. The Magdisūr entered Bengal through the mouth of the Meghna river, and many people were kidnapped and taken to Arakan as slaves. They were cleaned in Arakan's remote forests. Since then Bengalis' clan began to grow in the Arakan area.<\/p>\n<p>In 1824 the British army started a war with Burma. This is known as the first Anglo-Burmese war. The British army took control of Arakan in 1826. As part of the administration, British officials are located in the Chittagong district<\/p>\n<p>Encourages Rohingya and local Bengali farmers to go to the populated areas of Arakan. The continuous arrival of Rohingya and local Bengali farmers from the British-India, Trivandrum among local Rakhine Buddhists living in Arakan<\/p>\n<p>Creates feedback. They oppose it. That is the beginning of racial tension which is still present today.<br \/><br \/>During World War II (1939-1945) the pot was changed. British forces in front of Japanese aggression in South Asia<\/p>\n<p>Arakan left. After the withdrawal of British troops, the Buddhists started attacking Muslims. Gradually, Muslims and Buddhists are in conflict with each other. For some Muslim allies, spying against Japan<\/p>\n<p>Get started When Japan knows it, they have to kill all Muslims, kill rape, and commit cruel torture. About 40,000 Rohingyas fled to Chittagong.<\/p>\n<p>When Burma became independent in 1948, the government announced that Rohingyas are a 'recently arrived' tribe from the Indian subcontinent and they will not be considered as local indigenous people or Burmese citizenship. After the Second World War<\/p>\n<p>From 1962, the Muslims were demanding a separate Rohingya state in Arakan. In 1962 the military junta Ne Win completely rejected the demand and ordered its soldiers<\/p>\n<p>To strictly suppress the Muslims. The property of Rohingyas was forced to be taken away. They were put in refugee camps by overthrowing their own land and engaged in forced labor. Rohingyas have been running away from here since then. Thailand and Malaysia are much more.<\/p>\n<p>Recent problems started in 2012. Ethnic riot takes place between Buddhists and Muslims. Thousands of Muslims lose their lives.

The Gaur Sultanate of Bengal was then under the Mughal empire of Delhi. After taking shelter with Min-Sa-Moon, he worked as a government servant under Gaur Sultan for a long time.<\/p>\n<p>In 1429, Sultan Nadir Shah Khan-Min-Sa-Mun was encouraged to return his lost kingdom. With the help of Sultanate's arms and army, Min-Sa-moan succeeded in recovering his kingdom the following year. This resulted in the indirect rule of the Arakan king Gaur Sultanatan for 100 years from 1430 to 1531. At this time the Muslims grew in the region.<\/p>\n<p>Although the Arakan kings of this period were Buddhists in religion, they used to hold the Muslim title of loyalty to the sultanate. Kalima and Persian script were introduced in the time of Arakanese coins. During this time, Ben-Su-Mun's brother Ali Khan and son-in-law, Kalima Shah, were named as Ba-So-Pru, respectively, to Ramu and some areas around Chittagong.<\/p>\n<p>The state of Arakan expanded. During the reign of King Din-Bin, the 12th King Yuvaq Shah of this dynasty, got the final form of Arakan state prosperity from 1531 to 1553. He declared himself independent from the Sultanate of Bengal. King Min-bin recruits the Portuguese to build his army and Portuguese With the help of a strong naval force.<br \/>When the Bengal rulers declared independence against Mughal rule, Mughal Emperor Humayun attacked Bengal. In view of this unrest in Bengal, Arakan took over a large part of King Min-bin East Bengal. Next 120 Years this area was under the control of Arakan. Minin-Bin occupied parts of East Bengal ruled through local rajas. These kings paid tribute to the governor's office in Arakan State in Chittagong. At this time, various social relations between the people of this region started, and some of the Bengali language including the regional language of Chittagong The degeneration is available in Arakan, although small. Interestingly, Muslim rituals and cultures were started in the royal court in the region 350 years after Arakan gained independence and until the British rule in 1784. However, many Rohingyas claimed that their ancestors settled in Arakan in the eighth and ninth centuries. They are It is believed that the Rohingya Muslim population originated here by the Persian merchants who came in the seventh century, and later Muslims from different parts of India gradually became known and adopted as Rohingya. Their demand can not be blown away easily. The word 'arakan' is a word in Arabic or Percy language.<\/p>\n<p>It is considered as an illusion. But almost 100 years before the indirect rule of Gauda sultans, Arab poet Rashid Uddin identified this area as 'Rahan' in 1310. But later, in 1586, British tourist Ralph Flich described this area as 'Rokon'. It is obviously understood, once in this area. Muslims had strong political effects. Muslims did not come too late in this region compared to the current Rakhins claiming as the landowner of Arakan or the present northern Rakhine province. As far as it is known, in the area of ​​Mongla during the year 957, the Rakhines settled in this region.<\/p>\n\n \n \n \n<br>\n<\/div>\n \n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n \n \n","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"65737","category_id":"36603","descr":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n \n \n  <style> \n          h1 { \n\t\t\tcolor:#ffffff;\n            font-size: 1.5em;\n\t\t\tfont-weight: bold;\t\t\t\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t  p { \n\t\t\tcolor:black;\n            font-size: 1.0em;\n\t\t\t\n           \t}\n          p1{color: purple;\n \n            }\n          p2{\n          \tcolor: green;\n \n            }\n\t\th3 { \n\t\t\tcolor: red;\n            font-size: 1.1em;\n\t\t\tfont-weight: bold;\n\t\t\tbackground-color: white;\n\t\t\tpadding: .5em;\n           \t}\n\t\t  .content { \n\t\t\tcolor:#0c0c0c;\n            line-height:175%;\n\t\t\tfont-size:1.1em;\n\t\t\tpadding-left: .5em;\n\t\t\tpadding-right: .5em;\n\t\t  }\n\t\t  .Headera{\n\t\t  background-color:#4f0e2f;\n\t\t  padding: 1em;\n\t\t  text-align: center;\n\t\t  }\n\timg {\n\t\tmargin: auto;    \n\t\tmax-width: 100%;\n\t\theight: auto;\n}\n  <\/style>\n<\/head>\n \n \n \n<body>\n \n<div class=\"Headera\">\n    <h3>They wanted to join East Pakistan<\/h3> \n\t<h1><\/h1> \n  <\/div>\n<hr \/>\n \n<div class=\"content\" align=\"justify\">\n \n \n<p>After the British captured Arakan in 1784, Burma's contact with Bengal and other parts of India increased again.

Many Indians, especially the Bengalis, gather in the crowd.They got more importance to the British than the local Rakhines, and they were elected to the government posts. In the beginning of World War II in 1942, the Japanese captured Myanmar from the British. Local The Rakhines attacked the privileged people from the British with the support of the Japanese at this time. Their attacks are mainly due to Rohingya Muslims. On 28 March 1942, Rakhins killed nearly 5000 Rohingyas in Ramban and Mihbiya and Marohong Townshops As a counter retaliation, Rohingyas killed about 20 thousand Rakhines in the North Rakhine region. If the conflict is intense, the Japanese helped with Rohingyas by rakhainas. Myanmar remained under Japanese occupation till 1945. In these three years, at least 20 thousand Rohingya migrants from Myanmar came to Bengal. That journey has not stopped yet. In 1945 the British again occupied Myanmar. this Rohingya comes forward with their help. At that time, the British promised that in return for the assistance, the people of North Rakhine will form a separate state for Muslims. But, like many other promises, the British Raj did not keep this promise. During the Partition of India in 1947, a large part of the Rohingyas tried to bring Arakan State with East Pakistan. The Rohingyas contacted Jinnah about this. Rohingya also created a large armed group and took initiatives to engage Maungdaw and Boothdham areas with East Pakistan. Rohingya's initiative was a suicidal and it is a major reason behind the disparity in Myanmar. Myanmar's Buddhist people have identified the then Rohingya initiative as betrayal. Bihari refugee populations in Bangladesh as a direct aid to the Pakistani army in 1971 The common people have been subjected to hatred, but the Rohingya do not directly help, but the same is the victim of adverse public opinion in Myanmar. After the army took power in Myanmar in 1962, gradual increase in national discrimination against Rohingya Have to get Since 1970, recruitment from the Rohingya Muslim population has been stopped in the army. Since then, the Rohingyas in government service have been subjected to widespread discrimination.<\/p>\n\n \n \n \n<br>\n<\/div>\n \n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n \n \n","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"65738","category_id":"36604","descr":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n \n \n  <style> \n          h1 { \n\t\t\tcolor:#ffffff;\n            font-size: 1.5em;\n\t\t\tfont-weight: bold;\t\t\t\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t  p { \n\t\t\tcolor:black;\n            font-size: 1.0em;\n\t\t\t\n           \t}\n          p1{color: purple;\n \n            }\n          p2{\n          \tcolor: green;\n \n            }\n\t\th3 { \n\t\t\tcolor: red;\n            font-size: 1.1em;\n\t\t\tfont-weight: bold;\n\t\t\tbackground-color: white;\n\t\t\tpadding: .5em;\n           \t}\n\t\t  .content { \n\t\t\tcolor:#0c0c0c;\n            line-height:175%;\n\t\t\tfont-size:1.1em;\n\t\t\tpadding-left: .5em;\n\t\t\tpadding-right: .5em;\n\t\t  }\n\t\t  .Headera{\n\t\t  background-color:#4f0e2f;\n\t\t  padding: 1em;\n\t\t  text-align: center;\n\t\t  }\n\timg {\n\t\tmargin: auto;    \n\t\tmax-width: 100%;\n\t\theight: auto;\n}\n  <\/style>\n<\/head>\n \n \n \n<body>\n \n<div class=\"Headera\">\n    <h3>Operation Nagamin The first refugee wave in Bangladesh -1978<\/h3> \n\t<h1><\/h1> \n  <\/div>\n<hr \/>\n \n<div class=\"content\" align=\"justify\">\n \n \n<p>Emergency Immigration Act introduced by the government in 1974.

Myanmar gained independence on January 4, 1948 and started the journey towards multi-party democracy. At that time the Rohingyas were represented in parliament. Some of the population also hold public office responsibilities. But in 1962 When General Ne Win took the reign of a military coup, Myanmar's journey began to flow in different areas. Rohingyas are beginning a new chapter of suffering Since partition, Mujahidin continued the armed movement to separate the eastern region of Rakhine from Myanmar. That is, they started to govern Rakhain in the east. During this time, many Muslim Muslims came to Rakhine on the invitation of Mujahidin from Bangladesh and the Myanmar government started to sit without permission.In response, hundreds of Buddhist monks of Rakhine region protested against Mujahidin. Then the Myanmar government took the initiative to crush the power of Mujahideen. One day the Myanmar army took power from the Mujahideen. Many of the leaders died, no one escaped. These happen within a decade. Due to the separatist activities of Mujahideen, the military junta of Myanmar identified Rohingya as a foreigner. They deprive them of their civil rights. Took out the franchise. Religious and socially different Torture Prayer is barred from collecting. Regular events are caused by murder-rape. Property was taken away forcibly. Being engaged in forced labor. There is no scope for their education and health care. Marriage is not allowed. Children If there is no registration then. Ethnic identity is not allowed to be published. The number does not increase, therefore it is imposed for one restriction after one. The Rohingya people are known as 'Kala' by many people in mainland of Myanmar. The Bengalis also call it 'Kala'.<\/p>\n<p>Myanmar military and Buddhist Rakhines have been attacked by communal attacks, about one million Rohingyas have been dispersed from Myanmar and spread to different countries of Bangladesh, Thailand, Malaysia and the Middle East.<\/p>\n\n \n \n \n<br>\n<\/div>\n \n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n \n \n","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"65742","category_id":"36608","descr":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n \n \n  <style> \n          h1 { \n\t\t\tcolor:#ffffff;\n            font-size: 1.5em;\n\t\t\tfont-weight: bold;\t\t\t\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t  p { \n\t\t\tcolor:black;\n            font-size: 1.0em;\n\t\t\t\n           \t}\n          p1{color: purple;\n \n            }\n          p2{\n          \tcolor: green;\n \n            }\n\t\th3 { \n\t\t\tcolor: red;\n            font-size: 1.1em;\n\t\t\tfont-weight: bold;\n\t\t\tbackground-color: white;\n\t\t\tpadding: .5em;\n           \t}\n\t\t  .content { \n\t\t\tcolor:#0c0c0c;\n            line-height:175%;\n\t\t\tfont-size:1.1em;\n\t\t\tpadding-left: .5em;\n\t\t\tpadding-right: .5em;\n\t\t  }\n\t\t  .Headera{\n\t\t  background-color:#4f0e2f;\n\t\t  padding: 1em;\n\t\t  text-align: center;\n\t\t  }\n\timg {\n\t\tmargin: auto;    \n\t\tmax-width: 100%;\n\t\theight: auto;\n}\n  <\/style>\n<\/head>\n \n \n \n<body>\n \n<div class=\"Headera\">\n    <h3>The Rohingyas Problems<\/h3> \n\t<h1><\/h1> \n  <\/div>\n<hr \/>\n \n<div class=\"content\" align=\"justify\">\n \n \n<p>Rohingyas, denied by the Myanmar government as citizens, are denied access to all types of citizens and basic facilities.

Most people see it as a human disaster and communal riots. But Rohingya problem is not a temporary catastrophe, ethnic cleansing, which has been patronized for a long period of time. The Myanmar government wants to impose liabilities of about 20 lakh Rohingyas on our shoulders for all time. Myanmar government<\/p>\n<p>Officials often publicly deny this Rohingyas as illegal immigrants Bangladeshi. During this time Bangladesh will have to be cautious. Only because of the similarity of language, religion or anthropological structure, Bangladesh can not take responsibility of two million people of Myanmar. Recently, the government of Bangladesh took a bold step to not relax the border guard. The government should not be forced to withdraw from this position by submitting to any pressure in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Bangladesh can not be associated with Rohingya issue in any way. Bangladesh will have to take big initiative to give back the huge number of Rohingyas already entering the country. If they can not be returned to Myanmar about bilateral, then there is a need to increase diplomatic activity at the international level. Myanmar is no longer a closed country at the international level. In the path of democracy, the country is progressing one foot or two.<\/p>\n<p>To prove itself as a civilized country, Myanmar should quickly resolve the Rohingya issue. A large number of people living in a country living in centuries after centuries can not be citizenship. All the people of the world have a birthright, the Myanmar military leaders will deny that right, they can not continue. If the citizenship of Rohingyas is not given, then the world leadership alone will have to face the question in the history of the coming day.<\/p>\n\n \n \n \n<br>\n<\/div>\n \n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n \n \n","answer":null,"total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"65749","category_id":"36615","descr":"<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n<head>\r\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n \r\n \r\n  <style> \r\n          h1 { \r\n\t\t\tcolor:#ffffff;\r\n            font-size: 1.5em;\r\n\t\t\tfont-weight: bold;\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t  p { \r\n\t\t\tcolor:black;\r\n            font-size: 1.0em;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n           \t}\r\n          p1{color: purple;\r\n \r\n            }\r\n          p2{\r\n          \tcolor: green;\r\n \r\n            }\r\n\t\th3 { \r\n\t\t\tcolor: red;\r\n            font-size: 1.1em;\r\n\t\t\tfont-weight: bold;\r\n\t\t\tbackground-color: white;\r\n\t\t\tpadding: .5em;\r\n           \t}\r\n\t\t  .content { \r\n\t\t\tcolor:#0c0c0c;\r\n            line-height:175%;\r\n\t\t\tfont-size:1.1em;\r\n\t\t\tpadding-left: .5em;\r\n\t\t\tpadding-right: .5em;\r\n\t\t  }\r\n\t\t  .Headera{\r\n\t\t  background-color:#4f0e2f;\r\n\t\t  padding: 1em;\r\n\t\t  text-align: center;\r\n\t\t  }\r\n\timg {\r\n\t\tmargin: auto;    \r\n\t\tmax-width: 100%;\r\n\t\theight: auto;\r\n}\r\n  <\/style>\r\n<\/head>\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n<body>\r\n \r\n<div class=\"Headera\">\r\n    <h3>What the Rohingyas can do to solve the Rohingya problem<\/h3> \r\n\t<h1><\/h1> \r\n  <\/div>\r\n<hr \/>\r\n \r\n<div class=\"content\" align=\"justify\">\r\n \r\n \r\n<p>◘ Rohingyas form a working council, united under it Creating strong representation of the<\/p>\r\n<p>Rohingyas at the international stage through the Executive Council.<\/p>\r\n<p>◘ Take initiatives to create a database of all Rohingya.<\/p>\r\n<p>◘Take initiatives to work together with the United Nations in the management and management<\/p>\r\n<p>of Rohingyas for their educational needs and primary needs.<\/p>\r\n<p>◘ Participate in activities related to Muslim militancy and militant organizations.<br \/>◘ Promote Muslim anti-militancy ideology between Rohingyas.<br \/>◘ Handing over the program for Muslim militants in the Rohingyas can not spread.<br \/>◘ Legal measures with evidence against the Myanmar government in the International Human<\/p>\r\n<p>Rights Court.<\/p>\r\n<p>◘ Take initiatives and programs to create public opinion in the world.<br \/>◘ To influence the international community and organizations so that international communities<\/p>\r\n<p>and organizations in Myanmar.<br \/>◘ The government has put pressure on the Rohingya issue.<br \/>◘ Conforming to the international law in the usual legal ways that Myanmar is forced to solve<\/p>\r\n<p>Rohingya problem Continuing military-civil movement.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n<br>\r\n<\/div>\r\n \r\n<\/body>\r\n<\/html>\r\n \r\n \r\n","answer":"","total_up_vote":"0","total_down_vote":"0"},{"id":"65750","category_id":"36616","descr":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n \n \n  <style> \n          h1 { \n\t\t\tcolor:#ffffff;\n            font-size: 1.5em;\n\t\t\tfont-weight: bold;\t\t\t\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t  p { \n\t\t\tcolor:black;\n            font-size: 1.0em;\n\t\t\t\n           \t}\n          p1{color: purple;\n \n            }\n          p2{\n          \tcolor: green;\n \n            }\n\t\th3 { \n\t\t\tcolor: red;\n            font-size: 1.1em;\n\t\t\tfont-weight: bold;\n\t\t\tbackground-color: white;\n\t\t\tpadding: .5em;\n           \t}\n\t\t  .content { \n\t\t\tcolor:#0c0c0c;\n            line-height:175%;\n\t\t\tfont-size:1.1em;\n\t\t\tpadding-left: .5em;\n\t\t\tpadding-right: .5em;\n\t\t  }\n\t\t  .Headera{\n\t\t  background-color:#4f0e2f;\n\t\t  padding: 1em;\n\t\t  text-align: center;\n\t\t  }\n\timg {\n\t\tmargin: auto;    \n\t\tmax-width: 100%;\n\t\theight: auto;\n}\n  <\/style>\n<\/head>\n \n \n \n<body>\n \n<div class=\"Headera\">\n    <h3>What to do in Bangladesh to solve the Rohingya problem<\/h3> \n\t<h1><\/h1> \n  <\/div>\n<hr \/>\n \n<div class=\"content\" align=\"justify\">\n \n \n<p>◘ No Rohingyas are allowed to enter Bangladesh.<br \/>◘ Build lists of Rohingya who are in Bangladesh, and arrange strict surveillance.
